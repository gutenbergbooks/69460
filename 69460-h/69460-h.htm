<p><span class="smcap">May</span> it not be that in every family there are unborn
children—souls that have come too late perhaps to
find a medium, yet, in consequence of their hereditary
particles, unable to seek it elsewhere? We know not
what mysterious dissolutions and recombinations of
spirit take place in the realm where the released forces
go, with what deliberation the essences of families are remixed;
oftenest, no doubt, with commonplace results;
sometimes with intent to bring humiliation and disaster
upon a house which has transgressed too many laws;
yet again, combining the great characteristics of mind
and soul and temperament of those who have distinguished
themselves in history, with such weaknesses
as must inevitably destroy all three—as in the notable
instance of the last Rudolf von Hapsburg. Again,
the best may have been remixed with only enough
of human weakness and passion that love may be inspired
instead of awe, that happiness without disaster
may be possible. And yet the most fortunate of these
fusions may be finished too late for its generation, and
be forced to bide its time invisible; or perhaps, by some
spiritual statute of limitations, is deprived of its earthly
rights forever. Nevertheless, it may linger in spirit
where it should walk in its servant of flesh, and unknown,
unsuspected, take its part in the daily life
of its kin, having its own influence perhaps on their
destinies and on history. And the romanticist, so
much of whose time is spent in the unreal world, may
fancy, once in a way, that one of these belated souls
has swum into his ken, and that his privilege is to
rescue it, to fit it to the part for which Nature so tirelessly
equipped it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—The dinner described in Chapter IV., Part II. occurred
in 1897, but it being necessary that the action of the story
should take place several years later, I have brought it forward.
This of course could not have been done had certain circumstances
arisen which might have given immediate historic results
to the speech of the Emperor of Germany. Those circumstances
not having arisen, it makes little difference whether the
speech was delivered yesterday or six years ago. Otherwise, the
dinner, the speech, its effect upon the Hungarian magnates present,
its reception next day by the Hungarian press and people,

<h3 class="nobreak">I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Fessenden Abbott heard that he was to inherit
four hundred millions of dollars he experienced
the profoundest discouragement he was ever to
know, except on that midnight ten years later when he
stood on a moonlit balcony in Hungary, alone with the
daughter of an Emperor, and opened his contemptuous
American mind to the deeper problems of Europe.</p>

<p>His ambition had been immeasurable, yet almost defined.
His hopes had been the confident imperious extravagances
of a youth in whom narrow circumstances
and a high indomitable spirit had developed that ardent
personal force which equips man to conquer life. His
ideals had soared in stellar spaces—ideals created by
passionate brooding on the careers of Washington, Hamilton,
Napoleon, Nelson, Cromwell, Kossuth, the great
Hunyadis, Alexander, Cæsar, Rudolph the First of
Austria. How he had pored over the lives of this
catholic assortment of heroes while his fingers froze and
the winds roared through the Adirondack wilderness; on
hot summer afternoons as he trudged behind his plough,
the reins wound about one arm, his book in the bend of
the other, vaguely wondering sometimes why his manifest
delinquencies were never noticed.</p>

<p>As he looked back he marvelled at the bluntness of
his observation. His difference from the other young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
men of that high gallery of the continent must have been
obvious, and whenever he thought of his dead mother
it was to associate her with a magnificence of personal
environment which in time he grew to believe he had
borrowed from the <i>Arabian Nights</i> for the more loyal
framing of a created memory; certainly in real life, even
in those huge cities where men made money, even in
the vast cold palaces of Europe, of which he had read,
there could be nothing to-day like those splendors which
haunted his young mind.</p>

<p>He had just investigated the interiors of the toys of
his third Christmas when he was made to keep so quiet
for four days that he became a miserable and obstreperous
baby; on the fifth he forgot the troubles of his past
in a twelve-hours’ journey with his doting father. His
indulgent nurse had been dismissed, and a woman with
a white cap and a firm admonishing eye formed the
rear of his body-guard, and held him to the window when
his restless legs sent his father to the smoking compartment.
He could remember still his bewildered sensation
as the train climbed slowly through dark forests, as
hard black peaks travelled across his blinking vision. Of
the night ride through the woods in a springless wagon
he recalled little but the sharp accentuations of the
“bull’s-eye” and the deep sighs of his nurse. After
that, life for several years was too monotonous for memories.
He lived in a farm-house without toys and
sweets—which he quickly forgot—and after the departure
of his nurse at the end of three months his was the
life of any mountain-boy; out of doors in the wildest
weather, out of bed at six o’clock, cuffed, spanked,
roughly petted by the farmer’s mother, beside whose
bed he slept during the remaining years of his childhood.
Twice a year his father came and spent a day on the
Nettlebeck farm. In summer Fessenden led him through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
the woods, and exhibited his many treasures, expounded
the forest lore to which he had instinctively applied
himself as soon as he could run alone—unanticipative of
the lore to which it would be the golden key in more
difficult years. In winter they sat in the best parlor,
close to a red stove, which made the boy, little used to
the luxury of fires, sleepy and almost ill. Neither woods
nor fire inspired Mr. Abbott to many words. He examined
the boy in his studies, and took his physical
measurements, comparing them with previous entries
in a little red book. Then, after an interval of sound
fatherly advice, and another of tender interest, he usually
went to sleep; or remained motionless for hours, his
weary eyes fixed and rapt, his lips and nostrils quivering
occasionally, but stern, immobile, relentless, the lower
lip raised, the upper drawn down and under. His little
son fidgeted, coughed respectfully, yawned shamelessly,
and finally stole away. Mr. Abbott, upon his arrival,
always presented Fessenden with a box of books, several
red sweaters, and, as soon as he was old enough, a new
pair of trousers—for his Sunday use; the boy wore overalls
on other days. Mr. Abbott forbade him to clothe
his more conspicuous part in anything but red, that he
might be found in briefer time if lost, and avoided with
less effort in the hunting season.</p>

<p>The books were selected with a careful regard for his
succeeding years, and under their insidious gardening
his imagination developed and his horizon receded.
He received his elementary schooling from a young
woman on a neighboring farm. At the same time his
body grew tall and strong and his temper fierce. He
took as easily to fighting as to books; he was sometimes
ignominiously whipped by hulking mountain-boys, sometimes
he won against heavy odds, for he had an instinct
for the scientific rules of the game, a long wind,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
hard muscles, and the primitive delight of the small boy
in war. The fights were not uncommonly for the favor
of some baby minx, but oftener for the pure lust of battle.
He was frequently mangled and battered when his father
arrived, but Mr. Abbott merely laughed, and, on the
whole, seemed to approve his appearance. So passed the
uneventful years until his tenth birthday, when life began
to ring its changes.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">II</h3>
</div>

<p>Mr. Abbott sat in the rocking-chair by the hot stove
regarding his son with his dreamy far-seeing eyes. For
the first time Fessenden wondered who and what his
father was. This man was like no one in the books he
had read, like no one in the Adirondacks. He was a boy
of direct methods, and was about to ask for information
when his father spoke.</p>

<p>“I am more gratified at your physical development
than you will ever know, my son,” said Mr. Abbott, tenderly.
“When I brought you here you were fragile and
undersized; it was thought that your chance of becoming
a strong man, or of reaching manhood at all, was
perhaps two in ten. But I knew the magic of the mountains;
I made my experiment, and I have succeeded.
There are other things I wish to say to you, however, so
sit down and listen attentively.”</p>

<p>Fessenden, in a glow of expectation, fell upon a corner
of the sofa, and Mr. Abbott continued.</p>

<p>“Originally I planned to speak to you decisively when
you were thirteen or fourteen, but it seems to me that
you are brighter than most boys of your age; I think I
cannot begin too soon to prepare you for the future.
Some boys are taught to say their prayers. I presume
you have been taught to say yours by our good Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
Nettlebeck, and I am sure I hope you say them; but I
want you to repeat, every Saturday night before you lie
down, these words I am going to teach to you; if you
forget them, to rise in the coldest and darkest night,
stand in the middle of the room, and repeat them twice.
The words are these—write them down: ‘Life is a fight.
Millions fail. Only the strong win. Failure is worse
than death. Man’s internal strength is created by watching
Circumstance like a hawk, meeting her every spring
stiff and straight, laughing at her pitfalls—which in the
beginning of life are excess, excess, and always excess,
and all manner of dishonor. Strength is created by adversity,
by trying to win first the small battles of life,
then the great, by casting out fear, by training the mind
to rule in all things—the heart, the passions, the impulses,
which if indulged make the brain the slave instead
of the master. Success, for which alone a man
lives, if he be honest with himself, comes to those who
are strong, strong, strong.’ When you have finished
that I want you to repeat ‘No’ aloud for ten minutes.
The time will come when you will rejoice that ‘No’ flies,
instead of moving reluctantly, to your tongue. As for
that prayer I have given you, you may not understand
it all now, but you will as you grow older, better and
better; you will analyze and ponder upon it. Life is
choked and gasping with young men trying to get a decent
living, with thousands besides struggling for a
career, reputation. I shall do my best to educate you,
but I want you to grow up with the distinct understanding
that you must support yourself when that preparatory
period is over. I may be able to help you to
some sort of a position, but I may be dead—and I must
do what I can for your sister—”</p>

<p>“My what?” shouted Fessenden. “You never told
me I had a sister!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>“Did I not? I should have thought I must have mentioned
it. She was born when your mother died, and
her name is Alexandra. Do not interrupt me again, and
listen attentively. I wish you, as I have just said, to
grow up with the clearly defined idea that you must
make your own way in the world, make every dollar you
spend, owe your position, and the respect you may be
able to inspire, to your personality—to the dignity of
your character and the brilliancy of your mind. I shall
keep you here until you are ready for college, where I
hope to be able to send you; for, unlike many Americans,
I believe in educating a man like a gentleman. I have
just met with a piece of extraordinary good fortune: the
other day an old friend called on me for the first time in
many years; he told me that his son, a Harvard man,
and a profound student, was so delicate that he might
be obliged to spend the remainder of his life in the high
altitudes. I called on the young man immediately—his
name is Stanley Morris—and persuaded him to come
here, for I realized what such companionship would mean
to my bright little son. He was very glad of the suggestion,
and agreed, for the sake of a small annual sum, to
become your teacher—in time to prepare you for college.
It was a great relief to my mind, for I want you to remain
in this healthy mountain region until you are
grown, and, of course, expensive tutors and schools are
out of the question. He will be able to teach you
German and French among other things, and he has a
large library. Therefore, I shall not send you any more
books. Fortunately you need only these rough clothes
up here. I feel quite confident that I shall be able to
afford the small yearly sum Mr. Morris demands. But
you are never to forget that you are studying for equipment,
not as the mere routine of youth. Do you understand?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>“Yes, sir.” Fessenden was deeply impressed, but
longing, nevertheless, to get away from the stove and
steer the conversation to lighter topics. His young
brain felt as if it had been hammered. “Couldn’t you
send my sister up here?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No; you will have little in common till you are
grown. You would act detrimentally upon each other.
Girls have such a different part to play in life,” he concluded,
somewhat vaguely.</p>

<p>“I’d like her picture.”</p>

<p>“I will send it to you, but you are to promise me first
that you will not write to her. I want no sentimental
nonsense.”</p>

<p>“I hate to write letters, so I don’t mind promising.”</p>

<p>There was a long silence during which Mr. Abbott
dreamed and Fessenden squirmed.</p>

<p>“Are you a success, father, or a failure?”</p>

<p>Mr. Abbott jumped. “I?—well—I will let you judge
of that for yourself when you are grown.”</p>

<p>“Do you keep a grocery store?—or teach school?—or
write books?”</p>

<p>“No,” Mr. Abbott laughed. “But I get my humble
living honestly. I am a lawyer by profession.”</p>

<p>“What is a lawyer?”</p>

<p>“Dear, happy child! All in good time, my boy.
Now run out in the air if you like. Your cheeks are
very red. Perhaps you will find an apple in my bag.”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">III</h3>
</div>

<p>During the following week Fessenden read little and
was too amiably excited for battle. He had seen few
strangers in that primeval wilderness—no gentleman but
his father; and Mr. Abbott had taken pains to admonish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
him that he was never to forget he was a gentleman—to
criticise his table manners, gait, and carriage. In the
course of his last visit, after he had twice swept his son’s
elbows off the table and arrested his knife on its flight
to the butter-dish, he had said, severely: “I am not raising
you to be a congressman from a backwoods district.
Without manners your morals might just as well be bad
as good. I am no democrat. I believe in hard work,
and above all things I despise the idle fools that rich
fathers foist upon the world; but I equally despise the
man who ever forgets he was born a gentleman. You
were. One reason why I have persuaded Stanley Morris
to come here is that you may be reminded constantly
that you are not to grow up a country lout, and disgrace—your
sister, when the time comes for you to meet.
Do you think that small head can remember all this tiresome
advice?”</p>

<p>“Youbetcherlife! But can’t I fight any more?” Fessenden
had asked anxiously. “I feel my <i>goodest</i> when
I’ve wiped the face off’n a chap.”</p>

<p>“Oh, fight all you like. Never take an insult. Never
see a woman insulted. Never take a back seat. If you
did I’d disown you. But put on no airs, even when you
are being properly educated by Morris. I despise a snob
as much as I abhor a weakling.”</p>

<p>“What is a snob?”</p>

<p>“The snob is a man who furnishes comedy for others
and tragedy for himself.”</p>

<p>Fessenden’s eyes were a hard blue stare, but experience
had taught him that when his father was cryptic he
did not intend to be questioned further.</p>

<p>Two rooms on the second floor facing the south were
put in such order as young Abbott had heretofore associated
with the unlicensed imagination of the story-teller.
Not only were the walls covered with heavy red paper,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
but a special car was switched off at a distant station, and
its contents, when hauled the intervening miles and unpacked,
proved to be worn but red and luxurious furniture,
four bookcases, several heavy rugs, two stoves,
and some nine hundred books. Fessenden unwrapped
and shelved every book, his fingers tingling, unfaithful
for the moment to his chipmunks and rabbits, his hidden
places in the forest where he was the mighty leader of an
invisible robber band.</p>

<p>When all was in order, Mr. Stanley Morris arrived.
He was very tall and attenuated, with a bulging brow
and long pale fingers. Nature had designed him for the
ascetic and scholar, and doubtless had taken back a mere
sufficiency of his lung cells to complete her purpose.
On this shelf of the world he could live into old age,
pack his avid brain with the master thoughts of other
men, and one day, possibly, give to the world a thought
system of his own.</p>

<p>“He kinder gives me the dumps,” remarked Fritz
Nettlebeck, as he filled his pipe in the kitchen that evening.
“I don’t take to people who looks as if their brains
was distributed all over them. His head-piece is twice
the size of an ordinary man’s, but he looks as if he kept
that for Sundays, and any other part of him would do as
well for other days.”</p>

<p>“You’re gitten imagination,” said Christina, with contempt.
She was a sour and elderly virgin, hard-worked,
now that her mother was growing old, and disapproving
of her brothers in all their phases. Beaux were few in
that vast and lonely wilderness, and these few had passed
her by. Even the hired man had failed to succumb to
the potencies of propinquity and the only woman. She
was an uncommonly good cook for an American of her
class—her parents were Hamburgers—and had won favor
with the campers who ventured into this part of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
Adirondacks, Mr. Abbott among the number; but if her
cake was delicate, her griddle-cakes light, her venison a
culinary achievement, her temper had been bitter from
childhood, her sarcasm a thing to make a strong man
falter and slink away. Christina was very proud of this
substitute for scholarship, and persuaded herself that it
compensated her for all that lay buried in ligneous
spinsterhood. “The young un’ll have to turn to now, I
guess,” she continued. “Much chores you’ll git out of
him if he’s got to learn all them books. And he’s real
handy about the house, too. He’s mended a power of
things for me.”</p>

<p>“You’re sweet on that kid,” said Nettlebeck, with
borrowed sarcasm. “It’s about the only soft spot
you’ve got. But if you make him sick again on cocoanut-cake,
and his father finds it out, he’ll be packed off,
I give you that.”</p>

<p>“Who is that father of his, anyhow?” Christina never
argued when she was sure of defeat; and having sat up
all night with Fessenden—who had stolen the greater
part of the cake—she was not prepared to face the
enemy. “I don’t believe he’s as poor as he makes
out. The mortgage is paid off this farm, I happen to
know—”</p>

<p>“And you’re insinuatin’ that your two brothers ain’t
hard-workin’ enough to pay it off theirselves!” cried
Nettlebeck, bringing his fist down on the table with such
violence that Christina’s pile of clean plates rattled, and
she gave a wholly feminine shriek. “If you ever insult
me like that again I’ll git a wife, and how’ll you like
that?”</p>

<p>This threat never failed to subdue Christina, for although
she shrewdly guessed that no girl within a radius
of a hundred miles had the courage to become her sister-in-law,
she knew that a desperate man might make a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
pilgrimage to some distant town which her fame had not
penetrated. She sniffed, muttered something about not
being minded to insult her own family, whatever she
might think of folks in general, and carried off her dishes
to their shelves.</p>

<p>“Mr. Abbott,” resumed Nettlebeck, having given his
wrath such time to cool as a female could expect, “is a
generous and self-sacrificin’ father, and he just worships
that kid; he’d wear one suit of clothes a year to give him
what he needed, and of course keep don’t cost much up
here. As for this here Morris, he’s spent all his money
on books and furniture, thinkin’ he was goin’ to be a
college professor. Mr. Abbott must have got him cheap.
And the little we git from the old man’s regular. Just
you remember that.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t forgettin’. Nobody asked you to make excuses
for Mr. Abbott bein’ alive. I s’pose he ain’t payin’
fur that canoe, either.”</p>

<p>“That there canoe is a second-handed one, and I got
it dirt cheap. Mr. Abbott consulted me about it when he
was here last, and asked me to do the best I could, as
he’d like the kid to have a canoe if one could be got inside
his means. But Fess ain’t to know it’s here till his
birthday comes round; so mind your own business till
the ice goes out, if you can.” And Mr. Nettlebeck
slouched off to join his brother in the barn and avoid
further questions.</p>

<p>“I ain’t no fool,” confided Christina to herself, as she
“covered” her fire. “But I know which side my bread’s
buttered on, and the young un’ll git no hint from me.
Then when our share in raisin’ him is over, there’ll be a
big present all-round, or my name ain’t Christina Nettlebeck.
There’s been too many campers in these woods in
my time, and I know a rich man and a gentleman when I
see one. Mr. Abbott was the worst-lookin’ tramp in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
woods I ever saw, and that’s a sure sign. It’s lucky,
though, the kid’s what he is, for I couldn’t stand a hateful
brat, nohow.”</p>

</div>

<p>Like all invalids, Morris had little affection for any one
but himself, but what he lacked in human sympathy he
atoned for in courtesy of manner and nicety of conscience.
He instructed Fessenden until that restless youngster
besought Nettlebeck to find him many “chores.” But
Fessenden was still too small to chop down trees, to
plough ice, or to saw wood, and there is little other work
in the mountains in winter. There was no alternative
but to accommodate himself to his new condition, and
brace his endurance by repeating his father’s advice and
attempting to understand it. At the end of the long
winter he was studying hard and fighting less. Now
that he did not recite on the neighboring farm, there was
no one to fight with, except on such rare occasions as
when a boy came to borrow of Christina after some culinary
disaster at home or some unexpected shortage at
the mountain “store.” Fessenden, no matter how deep
in study, seemed to scent the messenger from afar, and
was standing in the middle of the slippery road, his
muscles bunched, his eye glaring like a tiger’s, when his
expectant foe, uttering a hideous war-whoop, flung his
bag into a snowdrift and hurled himself upon the champion.
Upon these occasions, Dolf, the younger of the
Nettlebeck brothers, always dropped his work and encouraged
the sport. When it was over, no matter what
the issue, Christina invariably cuffed Fessenden, then
made him a cake; and gentle old Mrs. Nettlebeck wept
profusely as she sponged him off, convinced that it would
yet be her mournful duty to lay him out. Her own sons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
had the peaceful blood of the German peasant in them,
and this enterprising American lad was a dear and perpetual
mystery. Upon one occasion, when he looked
like a blind puppy, and study was out of the question for
two days, Morris improved the occasion in the interest of
reform.</p>

<p>“You are a great fighter, Fess,” he began, tactfully;
“and it does my poor blood good to watch so much energy
explode. Only it seems to me a waste. Why don’t
you concentrate your energy in your brain and become
a leader by the force of superior will and intelligence?”</p>

<p>“When I fight with my head I fight with its outside,”
replied Fessenden dryly. “I’ve got to make myself understood,
and I do, you bet. And I’m not complaining
of the headache next day, neither.”</p>

<p>“Think of what I’ve said, however. You have established
your reputation as a fighter; you occupy the
proud position of champion among boys of your own age
and older. The raging hate which must saturate you
when fighting like a savage would make me feel mean
and terrified for days after. It is all very well to know
how to use your fists, and no doubt they are of service
to you here, and at your age; but they will play a small
part in after-life, and your character will play a very
great one. You are so constituted that if you would
learn to control yourself you could command your fellows
with little effort; and at least when you fight try not
to hate so hard.”</p>

<p>“How would you like Christina’s puddings with all
the raisins left out? Would you mind reading to me?”</p>

<p>“As long as you like.” And Morris made him comfortable
on the sofa, and read from the lives of ancient
warriors until the heir of the ages fell asleep.</p>

<p>Fessenden’s mind at this time was a virgin field into
which seeds fell to rise again and be tended by a curious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
young tiller. Those flung into a fertile crevice by Morris,
who took the responsibility very seriously, put out their
green heads in time. Fessenden nodded his recognition,
and, although they were by no means his favorite products,
between their insistency and a decreasing lack of
opportunity, he arrived, in the course of another year, at
the conclusion that it might be interesting to make boys
follow his lead without resorting to primitive methods.
“I suppose one might as well wait till one has a real call
to fight,” he remarked to himself with philosophy. “The
animals don’t fight till they have to—none, that is, but
dogs, and perhaps that’s living so much with us—we
sickin’ them on and all that. It’s good to fight, though,”
he added, with a long sigh, “even if the headache does
last longer than the fun—that’s a point. Perhaps Mr.
Morris is right, although I’d like to know what he knows
about it. Maybe I’ll try the other tack and see what
there’s in it, but there are some things will make my fists
fly till I’m eighty. I guess I wasn’t cut out for a Sunday-school
teacher.” Nevertheless, he worked himself into
such a terrific rage the next time he was challenged—after
an unusual period of virtuous abstinence—that he
was thoroughly frightened at the result: for several days
he felt flat and peevish, and more worn out in mind than
in body. Morris came upon him in the forest where he
was seated on a stump dismally chewing a cud, and embraced
an obvious opportunity.</p>

<p>“After all,” he said sympathetically, “what you fight
for is supremacy, is it not? Why not get it some other
way? Although you poison yourself with the hate you
feel while actually fighting, hate is never the motive of
battle with you. You like all these boys well enough,
but you must find out who is the best man or burst.
Find it out some other way—or rather, having decided
that point, try others. Besides, the great man uses the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
brute force of others, he rarely indulges in it himself.
Did not Napoleon sit aloft on a hill while his hundreds
of thousands of nameless minions did the fighting? So
long as they could see that being whom they looked
upon as an emanation from the divine intellect, they
were willing to fight like fanatics, but if he had rushed
forward with a musket and fallen, the ranks would have
scattered in irretrievable panic. Are you cultivating
your prowess to fight years hence when a great man
orders you out?”</p>

<p>“Not much,” growled Fessenden.</p>

<p>“Well, take me out in your canoe now. We’ll talk it
over further this evening.”</p>

<p>Fessenden’s twelfth birthday occurred a week later,
and he persuaded Christina to give him a party and invite
his enemies. They came, howling through the
mountain passes, brandishing big sticks as a manifest of
their readiness for the fray. But although, having been
invited to dinner and birthday cake, they expected a respite
of perhaps two hours, they were disconcerted, and
privately alarmed at being received by young Abbott
quite in the style of the grand seigneur. He wore a
new white sweater and a new pair of trousers, and he had
been scrubbed and brushed by Mrs. Nettlebeck until, to
mountain taste, he was offensively godly. He greeted his
weather-beaten guests with a hearty grip of the hand,
insinuated his appreciation of the forgiving spirit so
touchingly displayed, and when he had them all seated
about the table in the large kitchen he entertained them
brilliantly with anecdotes from his most exciting books,
while they devoured Christina’s substantial dainties.
When he had gorged them into a state of sleepy good-nature,
he led them out into the woods, and, mounting a
stump, invited them to spin yarns of personal prowess.
Each youth in turn told a tale of terrible adventure and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
glorious triumph, which Fessenden applauded as a host
should. When they were alert once more and ready for
action, he organized them into a band of pirates, and
they scuttled several ships with such demoniacal vigor
that they worked off all the steam that was left in them;
and departed at nightfall vowing that Fessenden—who
was now dirty enough to satisfy the most exacting standard—was
the finest fellow in the woods, and that they’d
never had such a Time since they were born.</p>

<p>After supper Fessenden untied his canoe, <i>Pocahontas</i>—whom
he loved better than any mortal except his
father—and pulled out into the evening shadows. The
Nettlebeck farm was on a clearing of some fifty acres on
the north and east shores of a large lake. Surrounding
it on three sides was the virgin unkempt forest, as yet
undesecrated by the lumberman or the logger. Just
beyond the clearing the forest grew to the shores of the
lake—a body of water so clear that in the early morning
and evening, until the ice came, or except when the winds
raged, the great spruces and pines, the beeches and
maples, looked as if petrified in one of the old glaciers
which had ground this vast region into form. Beyond
the lake, beyond the surrounding forest, rose the encircling
chain of gentle peaks, some barren rocks of eccentric
shape, others black with woods. This evening their
upper slopes were white with a late fall of snow. The
Nettlebecks, like all American farmers, had done what
they could to make Nature hideous, and their big house
with its haphazard additions, the barns and boat-house,
the ragged orchard and vegetable garden, were like a
patchwork apron on the robes of a goddess. But Fessenden
had turned his back on the Nettlebeck outrage,
and not a shingle could he see—not a column of smoke.
The blue shadows on the mountains were melting as the
stars came out. The silence was so intense that Nature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
seemed to laugh noiselessly at man’s puny attempt to
impress himself upon her higher solitudes.</p>

<p>Fessenden shot his canoe round a bend, and entered a
long water-pass, irregular, half-choked with reeds and
swamp, dark from the forest on the slopes of the gorge.
It led to another lake, the second in a long chain of lakes
great and small, on many of which some farmer had made
his clearing and erected his monstrosities. But the
gorge was long, and the next lake too wild and rocky to
invite the attentions of man. Fessenden could paddle
far, and fancy himself as alone in the great Adirondack
wilderness as the first Red Indian. From the day when
Mrs. Nettlebeck had allowed him to run unattended,
much of his time had been spent apart. The nearest
neighbor lived three miles away, on the farm where with
several other boys he had attended school of a sort for
four months in the year. The boys were kept busy at
other times, and only sought him out when, like himself,
they ached for a fight. Solitude had become as necessary
in his life as his bed and his bread; and except when
storms raged and the thermometer stood too far below
zero, he left the house the moment his studies with his
tutor were over, and took his reading into the woods or
his canoe. On Saturdays and Sundays he was not permitted
to open a book, and during the short summer
there were no mental tasks. He spent these holidays in
the woods or on the water, only returning to the house
for his evening meal and his hard bed. Occasionally
Morris accompanied him, and taught him much of practical
forestry; but although the man and the boy were
good friends, each preferred his solitudes—his long
silences.</p>

<p>To-night Fessenden was in a strangely exultant mood
which he was anxious to understand. He was tired, for
he had played hard; but it was a pleasant languor beside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
the exhaustion which followed his pitched battles, to say
nothing of their accompaniment of gaping wounds and
nervous depression. He had passed successfully through
his first attempt at diplomacy and self-command; his fists
had ached more than once, for Jeff Hunter was in fine
fighting trim and invariably lashed his crimson tide; and
he tasted all the sweets of power, of dominating in a new
rôle, of discovering unsuspected talents, and of using
them easily in the control of his fellows. He looked
back upon his career of fists and blood, this youngster
of twelve, with much the same disgust and contempt as
might animate a debauchee crossing the threshold of
reform. He did not return home until midnight, and in
those lonely hours under the stars, in the profoundest
stillness that America can give us, his ambition was born.
He felt able to go out and conquer the world then and
there; but he was modest by an earlier endowment, and
the value of a sound education had been impressed upon
his responsive mind. But his soul took a long flight,
and met on high vague and beautiful shapes, which,
when he was older, he knew men called ideals—looked
down upon a wonderful world far beyond these mountains,
wherein was stored the records of an eternity of
great deeds, where greater still were doing; where, in the
nebulous galleries of time, things beyond human imaginings
awaited the quickening touch of men still in the
making.</p>

<p>Fessenden returned and raided the pantry for a glass
of milk, but it was some time before he sought his bed.
In the depths of his soul the sleeping man still muttered,
and he felt like Mercury poised for a flight and not knowing
which way to turn, but half drunk with wondrous
possibilities. The full moon hung low on the reflecting
lake. The mountain-tops were white, their lower forests
black. The deer came noiselessly out of the woods and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
drank. The sublime and lonely scene murmured voicelessly
of its greater kin in the highest valleys of the alpine
world. Fessenden, standing on the upper veranda
of the house, again saw only Nature, unchanged since a
thousand years. Her silences might never have been
broken.</p>

<p>“You—kid!” cried a shrill voice as a window flew open.
“What on earth are you doin’ up this time of night?
Lands sakes! Git into bed this minute or I’ll come out
and cuff you good.” And Fessenden, who had a wholesome
respect for Christina, fled to his room and was
asleep in ten minutes.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">V</h3>
</div>

<p>But although solitude moulded unceasingly in the
structure of Fessenden Abbott’s character, and with coincident
intellectual development opened Gothic spaces
in his soul which made him lastingly different from the
city-bred man, yet was his life on the whole much like
that of any healthy youngster of his age who lived his
boyhood in an American wilderness. He played pioneer
to his complete satisfaction, and blazed trails in all directions
through the forest. In company with the redoubtable
Jeff Hunter, he built a hut on an island in a
lake of wild and uninhabitable surroundings, and impersonated
Crusoe to his old enemy’s Friday. This social
triumph was not won without another struggle, partly
fistic, partly diplomatic; and Fessenden regarded the
issue as his greatest achievement. After the first supper,
cooked by Friday and eaten with the graciousness of
royalty by his master, Jeff succumbed amiably and followed
Fessenden on such adventurous tramps as his
hard-working father would permit. They spent many
days and nights, during the summer months, on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
island, from which they sallied forth into the forest or to
the high peaks of the range in search of Nature’s dearest
terrors. They were once treed by a bear, whose cubs
they stumbled over; but managed to escape, by climbing
from tree-top to tree-top, when the bear was obliged to
return to maternal duties; they had, with what discrimination
was possible, selected trees too slender for the
bear to mount. During one of Mr. Abbott’s visits he
was entertained on the island; and by the light of a camp-fire
and to the accompaniment of ominous sounds in the
surrounding forest was regaled by an account of this
adventure, to say nothing of one with a panther, and
yet another with a catamount, told by Fessenden in a
direct unvarnished style which made his father tingle
with pride and an echo of youth. Shortly after, Fritz
Nettlebeck remarked to the boys that he had two shotguns
which “he guessed they were old enough to use,
and he’d teach ’em and give ’em the loan of the guns
provided they learned how to shoot straight and would
promise to be careful.” The immediate result was an
indiscriminate slaughter and loud protests from Christina,
who viewed an overstocked and gory larder with
disfavor. When, however, they had riddled and dragged
home a bear, they were thereafter too proud to kill small
game for other than purposes of replenishment. In the
hunting season they spent their Saturdays on the runs,
and killed more deer than the law allowed. One fine
buck was shipped to Mr. Abbott by Nettlebeck. Fessenden
had brought it down, and it was the prize of the season.
Having achieved this fresh distinction, Fessenden,
who, if he now fought rarely, still burned with youthful
ambitions, which had no relation to the swirling yet
luminous desires in his soul, organized a canoe race in
which boys from seven lakes competed. As his practice
had been constant for three years, and as he applied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
a very superior brain to the sport, he not unnaturally
came off best man; but this he did not realize, and he
embraced his canoe that night in a glow of complete
happiness. He had named her after his favorite girl in
history, and he loved her with his first boyish passion.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">VI</h3>
</div>

<p>Fessenden shivered and sat up in bed. It was the
first time he had ever heard sounds in the house at this
hour, and even the birds and the cocks were still asleep.
He felt more oppressed than curious, and, dressing hastily,
opened his window and slipped out upon the veranda.
The moon shone on vast fields of ice and
snow, on white peaks sharply defined against the dark
starry sky, on great stretches of woods whose heavy
spruce and naked maples were laden and glittering.
The lake was a sheet of ice several feet in depth. Fessenden
had driven a team across it yesterday to the opposite
woods, where the men were chopping trees blown
down in a recent storm. The thermometer was very
low, but the air so still that the cold had no sting in it.
Without the house the world might have been dead; but
not so within. Several people seemed to be moving
about in a curious and stealthy manner. Suddenly
some one ran down the hall and back again. Immediately
after there was a scream from Christina, followed
by a silence so sudden and complete that it seemed profounder
than that without.</p>

<p>How he realized at once that Mrs. Nettlebeck was dead
he never knew. She had not been a strong woman for
years, and had spent more and more of her time in the
big rocking-chair, looking out on the lake or reading her
Bible; but when he had kissed her as usual the night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
before, she had prodded him playfully in search of damaged
bones, and told him in her broken English that she
forgot she was too old to work while she watched him
skate and turn somersaults on the ice. Fessenden knew
that she loved him more than she did her own children,
for he interested her and they did not, and he showed
her much demonstrative affection, which they thought
beneath their religiously acquired Americanism—if indeed
there were any impulses left in those dry economical
natures. And now Fessenden looked about vaguely
as if in search of the fleeing spirit. For the moment it
seemed to him that he vibrated in unison with the great
forces beyond the Universe. It was several days before
he was conscious of grief and his loss, but he tingled with
cosmic curiosity.</p>

<p>Morris’s window was open, and himself buried under
so many blankets that he did not hear Fessenden enter
the room. He sprang up when gripped by the shoulder,
however, and after a brief visit to the death-chamber
returned and endeavored until morning to answer his
pupil’s eager almost incoherent questions. He expounded
every belief he had investigated. After Fessenden
had concluded that he would prefer to think of his
poor old friend in that Nirvana where there was no more
work, he went out and spent the day in the woods by
himself. This new idea of Death and its impenetrability
to mortal light seemed to him magnificent; and Christina,
hastily patching together a shroud out of sheets—old
sheets at that—and Fritz and Dolf, not even assisted
by the hired man—who was sent to chop wood as usual—hammering
together a rude coffin, while a few neighbors
stamped through the defiles to “help lay the old lady
out,” filled his ardent young mind with revolt.</p>

<p>The burial-ground was ten miles distant, close by a
church, a mountain store, a post-office, and three or four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
houses—a hamlet in a clearing through which a stage
passed twice a week. Once a month the church was visited
by an itinerant preacher. Mrs. Nettlebeck, to the
satisfaction of her family, had accommodated her setting
forth to the Methodist’s returning flight, and, as there was
no time to lose, her remains, on the night following her
death, were placed on the “jumper”—a low sledge—and
driven through the snowdrifts of the forest by torchlight.
Fritz drove; Christina stood beside him, arrayed
in fragments of hastily contributed black; Fessenden and
his faithful chum tramped in the rear; and Dolf and the
hired man lighted the way with great pine torches.
The jumper was on runners; the men and the boys
wore snow-shoes, for the snow was often five or six feet
deep; now and then the rude vehicle plunged into a drift
and had to be dug out, while the coffin was deposited
beyond the reach of the plunging horses. Once the
coffin disappeared, and as no one could remember exactly
where it had been placed, and the pitch-pine was
smoking heavily, it was some time before the treacherous
catafalque was discovered. After the box had been
dug out and safely hearsed, Fessenden let fly his wrath.</p>

<p>“Why on earth can’t you bury the poor old lady in
the forest?” he demanded. “You’re treating her horribly,
in my opinion; and I’d like to know what better
church-yard any one wants than the woods.”</p>

<p>“I guess this family’ll git Christian burial every time,”
replied Fritz. “But I must say it’s mighty inconvenient
dyin’ in the winter. Still, we can spare the time
better than if we was sowin’ or harvestin’; there’s something
in that. You can’t for to git everything right in
this world.”</p>

<p>And the tramp went on through the forest, where the
late moon rarely penetrated, and the wild torches peopled
the caverns of the dark with the evil spirits which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
had haunted the forests of the old peasant’s childhood,
and cast sinister shadows over the stark outline bumping
close to the ground. Mrs. Nettlebeck had been a bit of
a cynic in her way, for she had never been persuaded that
the transit from her quaint comfortable village in the
toy state of Hamburg to this souring struggle for existence
in an aboriginal wilderness had exalted her second
condition over her first; and Fessenden wondered if she
were smiling grimly in her coffin at the hardships of her
final journey.</p>

<p>They arrived at the settlement in the late sunrise, but
although several neighbors had assembled to help them,
neither pick nor spade made any impression on the frozen
snow, many feet in depth, which covered the church-yard
and its graves. The preacher managed to flounder
through the drifts to his duty, and preached a long and
dismal sermon on the platitudes of life and death, which
further outraged Fessenden; and then Mrs. Nettlebeck
was stowed away in a little room behind the pulpit to
wait till the spring came and the “ice went out.”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">VII</h3>
</div>

<p>It was several days before Fessenden realized that he
felt something more than natural grief at the death of
Mrs. Nettlebeck. He knew that his father loved him,
but Mr. Abbott’s visits were brief and far between, and
his infrequent letters rarely covered a sheet of notepaper.
Fessenden now had his ardent following among
the boys of his region, but boys manifest their liking by
loyalty, not by sentiment. Fritz and Dolf treated him
with good-natured indifference; he would as soon have
thought of kissing one of the scraggy winter maples as
Christina, in spite of her cross indulgence, and Morris<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
might have been a disembodied spirit. Mrs. Nettlebeck
had been his one steady well of affection. She had
petted and crooned over him since he had come to her,
a baby in a chronic state of disapproval with his nurse;
and the large measure of rejected love that was still in
her she had lavished upon him daily. He had taken it
as a matter of course, for he was lordly and masculine,
and there was no sharp contrast of neglect and ill-treatment
to fuse it into light. But now that the magic had
gone abruptly from him, and there was nothing to take
its place, he felt himself up against the barren rocks of
life; for the first time the future seemed to hold vague and
unknown terrors, the present to be less than the supremely
satisfactory thing he had esteemed it. He went first
for consolation to his canoe, whom perhaps he loved the
more ardently as her responses held an exciting element
of doubt. But <i>Pocahontas</i>, like the bears, seemed to
“deaden” in winter, at all events to be coldly impersonal
until she was skimming above the sunken ice before the
first breeze of spring. So he left her to the chill repose
of the boat-house, and poured out his lonely and frightened
soul to his father. Mr. Abbott answered that he
would go up to see him at once, and did manage to pay
his son a flying visit in the course of a month. But by
this time Fessenden was ashamed of his reckless exhibition
of sentiment, and, like a true American, had jealously
concealed his gushing fountains under a cool, alert,
and practical exterior. When his father arrived his
head was high, and his blue eyes keen and bright, his
very muscles expressive of masculine impatience with
the soft side of life. Mr. Abbott had brought him a
fishing-rod, which appeared to afford immediate consolement;
and then, somewhat to his father’s relief, he
began to talk about American history.</p>

<p>“Mr. Morris wanted me to wait until I had read more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
of English and foreign history,” he said. “But I
couldn’t, and I’ve been reading out of hours. We’ve a
great country, haven’t we?”</p>

<p>“Great.”</p>

<p>“Up here they all think it’s the greatest in the world.
Is it?”</p>

<p>“That is largely a matter of experience. Personally, I
see more in the future than in the present. We have
never been whipped. That is fatal to steady and rounded
development. A nation, like man, is full of vanity
until life has trounced him more than once.”</p>

<p>“I should hate it if we had ever been licked. And we
have had such grand men to guide us—I have read the
lives of Washington and Hamilton and Franklin; and we
have such grand ideals—after I read the Declaration of
Independence I went out into the woods and whooped
and whooped. With that to live by we can’t be in need
of a trouncing; and of course all other men try to follow
in the footsteps of our great ones—there are a lot of
others whose lives I haven’t had time to read yet.”</p>

<p>Mr. Abbott turned his eyes to his son’s flushed face,
and opened his straight lips as if about to smile and
speak. But he closed them quickly, and brought down
his lids over his cold dreaming eyes.</p>

<p>He answered in a moment: “Our ideals, like our
theories, are the best in the world. When you are
launched out into the hustle, it will be time enough to
know how they work. Meanwhile, don’t worry about
your country—it has an amazing power of taking care of
itself; but develop your intellect and your strength of
character. Do you repeat that lesson of mine once a
week?”</p>

<p>Mr. Abbott invariably asked this question, and Fessenden
was usually able to nod satisfactorily. He continued:
“A man who came up here once said that this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
was the rich man’s country, that the poor man was getting
less and less of a show, and often couldn’t get justice.
They all argued after that—it was down at the store;
but it didn’t seem to lead anywhere, and I’d like to
know what he meant. Was he only talking? Is that
the reason you are poor? You seem to me the cleverest
man in the world—and even Mr. Morris thinks an awful
lot of you—he’s not much on admiring. Are you ground
down by the rich? I should think you could sail into
’em, and send ’em all higher’n a kite.”</p>

<p>Mr. Abbott opened the door of the stove and poked
the fire. Its red glow was reflected in his face, usually
the hue of leather.</p>

<p>“I cannot say that the rich have interfered with me,”
he replied, after a considerable pause. “I have chosen
my own course, and have felt justified in pursuing it.
Don’t believe all this twaddle about the rich, my son.
It is their enterprise that has made this country great,
not the growling of the failures. It is they who encourage
and promote industries, whether their employees like
their manner of doing it or not. It is they who make the
money circulate, find employment for millions, keep
the fires crackling under the great boiling caldron.
Moreover, most of them have risen from the ranks of
these grumblers—who, one and all, dream of reaching
their altitude and having their chance to dictate to
those still below. Never forget that point. Every
working-man on strike is a potential millionaire—in fact
as well as in fancy—for this country offers equal chances
to all. It is the brains of the men that are not equal;
and every millionaire has only himself—in rare instances
his immediate forebears—to thank that he is not still
grovelling with the herd, close to the wall.”</p>

<p>“Then of course the millionaires have the really great
minds nowadays. Having done such wonderful things,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
I should think they would feel as if all the rest of the
world were their children.”</p>

<p>“H’m! My son, I think it is time for you to go to
bed.”</p>

<p>Fessenden, until his Great Love Affair, which occurred
when he had rounded his seventeenth year, lived in his
books and the future, finding less and less companionship
in his now humble and devoted band of followers.
This interval of four years was pricked out by two variations
only: the gradually discontinuing visits of his
father and the slight change incident upon a letter
received from Mr. Abbott on his son’s fifteenth birthday:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Boy</span>”—(this letter began, in the well-bred but
curiously unexercised handwriting which sometimes made Fessenden
wonder if his father never wrote to any one else)—“It
may be some time, perhaps years, before we meet again. I shall
give you no reason now for this additional separation, so painful
to me. When the time comes I shall explain, and you will find
the explanation satisfactory. Meanwhile, I shall write to you
twice a year, remind you of all the advice and admonition I have
given you, and ask many questions. I am very much gratified
with Mr. Morris’s accounts of you. It is in your blood to take
naturally to books. I hope and pray that other things may
come as readily to you in due course.</p>

<p>“I have now concluded that you are old and strong enough to
support yourself—barring your tuition, which I shall manage to
meet. I am writing to Nettlebeck to put you to work during the
fine weather. As you know, I prefer you should not study during
those months, and you will be paid what will more than
meet your expenses the year round. You are quite equal to the
work of a farm-hand, and it is time you knew how it feels to earn
money. It will also be a very considerable relief to me, besides
accustoming you to the fit of the harness before it is imperatively
necessary to put it on. Your sister is well, and sends you her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
love. I add mine, and I beg you to believe that in spite of appearances
I love you devotedly—more than I have ever loved
any one. You ask for my picture. I have never had one taken.
I have my reasons. One is that a man always seems to me most
of an ass when smirking on cardboard.</p>

<p class="right">“Your very affectionate &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br>

“<span class="smcap">Father</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>“He believes in disciplining,” remarked Fessenden to
Morris, with some acerbity. He was not enchanted at
the prospect of being a farm-hand. “If I must I must,
but somehow I can’t believe my father is as poor as he
makes out. If he is poor, it must be because he wants
to be, for it always seems to me as if a sort of power came
straight out of him, and hit me hard. And up here,
where all men are equal—quite unlike what you say it is
in cities—the Nettlebecks show him more respect than
they ever show any one else.”</p>

<p>“That is the mere force of personality. You can have
the same experience when you are grown, if you make of
yourself a strong and isolated spirit, not a mere creditable
member of a type. As for your father, his opinions are
worth their weight in gold. Obey him without question—therein
lies the success of your future. He is not only
a man of remarkable brain-power, but he is between three
and four times your age. He is helping you now out of
his own experience. Be thankful that he takes so great
an interest in you, instead of spoiling you in the usual
criminal American fashion.”</p>

<p>“His interest appears to be more excessive than his
love.”</p>

<p>“Cannot you take love on trust?”</p>

<p>“Does anybody take anything on trust? Can I eat
nails and believe them bread? I know what I see, what
I feel, what I am permitted to enjoy. I might say to
myself twenty times a day, ‘My father loves me,’ and it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
wouldn’t make one-thousandth the impression that a
weekly visit of ten minutes would.”</p>

<p>“A weekly visit from Mr. Abbott—” Morris checked
his laugh abruptly. “Your father is not too strong,
and hates travelling. But you have brain and imagination;
it is odd you should need the regularly administered
pap of the ordinary youth.”</p>

<p>“I am human,” responded Fessenden dryly; and as
usual he went to <i>Pocahontas</i> for comfort and counsel.</p>

<p>The world was green on this birthday of his, for the
spring had come early. The snow had gone from the
mountains, the young maple-leaves were fluttering in the
forest, the fields were green, the golden sunshine flooded
the lake. There was a light breeze, and Fessenden unfurled
his sails and thought into the sympathetic soul
of his canoe.</p>

<p>“Perhaps, on the whole, I like the idea,” he admitted.</p>

<p>“With one or two exceptions, our great men have
risen from the ranks—were hired men, grocery-store
clerks, born in log-cabins, and all that sort of thing. To
be sure, my favorites happen to be the ones who were not;
still it seems to be the proper thing in this country, and
as I intend to be a great man, old girl, I am contented
to start at the proper place—no log-hut could be uglier
than the Nettlebeck farm-house, and I am going to be a
hired man, all right. I can’t help being thankful that
it isn’t to be a grocery-store clerk. What am I to be?
What am I to be? Can’t you give me a hint?” He laid
his ear to the spot where he fancied the heart of <i>Pocahontas</i>
beat warmly, and for him alone. “When I read
the life of a great warrior, I want to be one. Upon
some other occasion I want to be a great statesman and
orator, and spout the seventh-of-March speech in the
woods, as exalted as if the world listened—and feel like
a fool afterwards. Write? Morris says there are too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
many writers now, and that my brain is that of the man
of action. He certainly seems to know more about it
than I do, and as for you, my beauty, you’re a selfish
hussy. When your sails are up you think of nothing
but filling your belly with wind.”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">IX</h3>
</div>

<p>Fessenden was so preoccupied that even the voices
and laughter of girls did not attract his attention for
some moments. He was inserting the little nickel
troughs called spiles into the trees of the maple orchard,
and hanging the red buckets beneath to catch the sap.
Dolf was in the sugar shanty nearby, scouring out the
vats, for the boiling would begin to-morrow, and maple-sugar
was an industry from which the Nettlebecks derived
a yearly income of several hundred dollars. This
year Fessenden, who was now seventeen and tired of
being a farm-hand, had stipulated that he was to work
on shares, arguing that if he did two-thirds of the work
he was entitled to at least one-third of the profits. Nettlebeck,
after some demur, and a long growl over his
pipe one evening, capitulated when young Abbott threatened
to stake off a claim on government land and in
partnership with Jeff Hunter build his own vats. Fessenden
was feeling much elated over his rise in life, and his
imagination was running riot in a great future to which
sugar should be the stepping-stone—he had recently
read several articles on self-made men in magazines
sent to Morris—when his house of cards came tumbling
down, and the future financier rose from the ruins, a
blushing, shivering, gibbering swain.</p>

<p>“This here is Grace Morton, Fess,” remarked the dry
young voice of Mamie Hunter. “She’s come to stay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
with me a spell. Lives down to Malone, and ain’t very
well.”</p>

<p>During this elaborate introduction Fessenden was
gazing into the soft black eyes of the prettiest girl he
had ever seen. Her hair was dark, her features fragile
and regular; she wore a black frock and a red-peaked
cap, red about her throat and tiny waist. Her complexion
was sickly, her figure might have been that of the
last woman, but Fessenden saw no defects. Neither did
he recognize the vacant, the utterly commonplace mind
that looked from that sweet unchanging face. She was
a little beauty in her way, and wholly unlike the buxom
rough-handed girls of his district; there pervaded her
that neutral refinement which nature has lavished with
such a curious lack of discrimination upon all classes in
the United States; and to Fessenden, who had never seen
even a village, she seemed city-bred and fashionable.
She blushed under his devouring gaze, and then she
looked like a wild rose of the woods; one barrier fell.
She raised her eyes and glanced vaguely round.</p>

<p>“I’ve never seen the sap running before,” she remarked.
“It looks real nice. Is it sweet like what we
eat on cakes?”</p>

<p>“You goose!” exclaimed Miss Hunter. “It’s got to
be boiled down first—the water boiled out of it; not that
it’s so bad now.”</p>

<p>Fessenden had produced a tin cup and filled it with
the running liquid. “Will you taste it?” he asked
hoarsely.</p>

<p>She took the cup from him, and their fingers met. He
trembled. She did not, and tasted the sap daintily.
“Well, I like it,” she announced. “It’s real refreshing,
and we had a long walk over here. I never walked so
far before, and I’m all tuckered out. I guess I’ll sit
down.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>Fessenden hastily cleared off a log, and regretted that
he had no coat to fling upon it—for obvious reasons he
could not remove his sweater. She seated herself with
the fastidious little manner which pervaded her personality,
and Miss Hunter, remarking that she guessed she
was not wanted, strolled off to call on Christina. Fessenden,
humbly craving permission, seated himself beside
the beauty from Malone, regardless of the sap that was
flowing from the punctured trees which still awaited spile
and bucket. They talked disconnectedly of various
things, no one of which could Fessenden recall later.
Her remarks were pleasant and meaningless and she was
utterly unmoved. She thought this young mountaineer
very handsome and clever-looking, and she had a faint
romantic preference for tall men; but her poor little
body was not destined for reproduction, and her brain
was too small for imagination and sentiment. She was
vain and liked attention, but she was without guile,
and as she had no immediate reason for marrying, her
mother keeping a small store comfortably, she encouraged
no one of her admirers, while accepting the homage
of several as a matter of course. The wild tempest in
Fessenden she could not have understood with the aid of
a miracle.</p>

<p>“Is this your first visit to the woods?” asked Fessenden,
who wondered dully why he was so stupid; he could
think of nothing to say to this divine creature, and
words, as a rule, came to him almost as rapidly as
thoughts.</p>

<p>“No, I’ve never been before. I always wanted to.”
Her voice was sweet and thin; it was only when she
raised it that it escaped through her nose. To the infatuated
Fessenden it sounded like the rilling of one of
the minor streams in the woods.</p>

<p>“I hope you’ll stay a long while.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>“I guess I will. Most of our folks’ve died of consumption,
and I’ve had a hackin’ kind of cough. But I
guess I’ll get over it here. I’m better already.”</p>

<p>If there was a mutter of protest from the race in
Fessenden’s depths he let it pass unheeded. His suddenly
conceived and violent passion needed but the lash
of pity to transform him from the individual into the
type, tumultuous with sentimental desire; the instinct
of the strong to protect the beloved weak, keen and
quick; pouring into a flimsy shell such an ideal as man
knows only in his dreams—the determination to possess
this inestimable treasure though the world stood still
and the angels warned through brazen trumpets.</p>

<p>“I hope this log isn’t damp,” he said anxiously. “I’d
better fetch you something from the house to sit on.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’d be afraid to stay here alone, and I can’t walk
another step. It’s bad enough to walk home. I guess
this log’s all right. Have you ever been to Malone?”</p>

<p>“Never!” Fessenden for the first time realized his
rude wild state. “I’ve never been twenty miles from
here.”</p>

<p>“My! you are a country bumpkin. I’m sorry if I’ve
hurt your feelings,” she added contritely as Fessenden’s
sunburnt face assumed a purple hue. “I’m always
saying silly things. You mustn’t mind me. The boys
always say I just rattle out anything that comes into my
head, and they don’t mind a bit.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t either,” said Fessenden quickly; he
was determined to equal the Maloner in insensibility.
“I should think”—he blundered somehow through his
first compliment—“that anything you said would be
about right.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s what they tell me,” she replied complacently.
“You can get me another cup of that sap
if you like.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>Fessenden held the cup to her mouth, which was thin
and curved and scarlet. Then, partly because his emotions
were rendering him speechless, partly because he
was fired with the primitive desire of the male to show
off before the female, he swung his axe to his shoulder
and muttered that he guessed he’d better cut down a
tree; he was wasting too much time.</p>

<p>His axe he always carried with him. It occupied a
place in his affections second to his canoe, and preceding
a more lukewarm passion for his gun. In a moment
Miss Grace Morton, of Malone, was admiring a lithe
strong back, the supple free action of two brawny arms
as the axe swung as easily as a switch, cutting straight
and deep at every stroke. The old tree was quickly
brought to earth, and Fessenden leaned on his axe and
dared once more to look into the soft eyes beneath the
red cap.</p>

<p>“It was time that old tree came down,” he remarked
huskily, yet with a fair assumption of indifference. “It
hasn’t given any sap for two years, and has been bothering
the other trees.”</p>

<p>“Bothering? You talk as if trees was people.”</p>

<p>“Well, they are in a way—that is, they’ve often
seemed alive to me.”</p>

<p>“My! You ain’t crazy, are you?”</p>

<p>Fessenden laughed, and a term of endearment ran
close to the tip of his tongue. “People who live much
alone have odd fancies. But that doesn’t mean they’re
crazy.”</p>

<p>“I guess they’re crazy enough if they’re too different.
But you look real sensible. I presume you’re all right.”</p>

<p>She looked adorable in her feminine attempt to console
him, and Fessenden wheeled about and swung the axe
victoriously into a fruitful maple. This time the young
lady was bored. She preferred conversation, and this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
mountain stripling certainly was handsomer than the
Malone small-fry who worshipped at her shrine.</p>

<p>She coughed pleasantly but imperiously, and as Fessenden
turned quickly the sun blazed full upon her, covering
her bright hair with little golden sparks. Her
eyes looked babyish and wistful; she had one of those
mouths that quiver when pouting. The poor little
creature was the more dangerous for being quite natural
and sincere. She had neither the brains nor the energy
for coquetry, and even to youths of some slight experience
she seemed as perfect as she was pretty.</p>

<p>Fessenden threw aside his axe. “Let’s go down to
the lake,” he said, with brutal abruptness. “It’s not
far, and I’ll row you and Mamie home—here she comes.”</p>

<p>He strode on ahead, and when the girls reached the
shore he had one of the boats drawn up to the landing.
He rowed with such swift strong strokes that the light
craft fairly flew up the lake.</p>

<p>“My, Fess!” remarked Mamie Hunter. “You appear
to be in a hurry—must have wasted time after I left
you.”</p>

<p>“Of course the trees have to be spiled, but Miss Morton
was too tired to walk home. You shouldn’t have
brought her such a distance the first time.”</p>

<p>“She didn’t calculate on finding a nurse ready made;
she’s real fortunate. Perhaps you’ll come over and carry
her next time.”</p>

<p>“I should like to.” He smiled protectingly into the
impassive expectant eyes; even in the throes he was
the lordly male. Moreover, pride had shaken him into
a temporary possession of his senses. “What do you
think of our scenery?” he asked Miss Morton.</p>

<p>“It’s real pretty.”</p>

<p>“Pretty? Beautiful, I should call it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess beautiful suits it better.” If he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
applied to it erudite and foreign adjectives she would
have assented as amiably.</p>

<p>“Fess is a crank,” advised Mamie. “You mustn’t
mind anything he raves over. You’ll be the next thing,
I suppose—he’ll find it quite a relief after so much brain
work.” Mamie was an admirer and disciple of Christina,
besides possessing a quick and observing eye of her own.
She had a long, investigating nose, and no beauty whatever;
but with the boys, whom she treated villanously,
she was the most popular girl in the district.</p>

<p>“Have you read much?” asked Fessenden of his divinity,
ignoring Mamie.</p>

<p>“Oh yes.”</p>

<p>“What? Shakespeare? History? Biographies?”</p>

<p>“I guess so. I always forget people’s names that
write things.”</p>

<p>And even then the rosy halo swirled unrent. Fessenden
returned home and viciously punctured his trees.
At supper he was so incoherent that Christina arose and
felt his pulse. He passed the greater part of the night
wandering in the woods. During the ensuing fortnight
he spent every evening at the Hunters’. Several times
the girls came to the sugar shanty where he was boiling,
and he rowed them home in the dusk. He lived aloft
with the gods and the goddesses, one of whom was Grace,
who gradually assumed heroic proportions. It mattered
not that every interview betrayed her paucity the more
pitifully; it mattered not that he never once struck fire
in that meagre breast, that never once did her brain respond
to the confidences, the ambitions, the aspirations
he poured into her puzzled and ofttimes weary ear. He
no longer loved Grace, little as he realized that world-old
fact; he loved the ideal it was her limited destiny to
quicken in his imagination. The great forces rushing
through his veins and thumping in his brain had nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
in common with mere facts and girls. They were having
their first innings, and not even grateful to the cause.
Nothing in the vagaries of nature is more inexplicable
than nine-tenths of what, for want of a better name, is
called love. It is a wanton waste of good energy and
a lamentable waste of spiritual forces; for the passion
moves the victim to all sorts of unselfish impulses, exalted
emotion, and even religion, all of which, in the reaction
when delusion is over, are finely scorned. That love
which is composed of an instinct for companionship, and
a complete honesty of emotions, and is lacking in sentimentalism
and the tragic note, delays its arrival, to people
of ardent imagination, until so late that they must
have much richness of nature and large recuperative
powers to dismiss into the past the memory of all they
have spent. The theory that the blind passion of youth
springs from the relentless instinct of reproduction is
true only in part, for some of the maddest passions are
inspired by anæmic and useless women, and the earth
has its full measure of sickly children. If Nature has
any well-defined plan she has as yet hesitated to reveal
it, and it is probable that she is still amusing herself in
her laboratory. Most love would appear to be a momentary
fever of the imagination to which the body responds,
and the soul, always struggling for utterance, tries its
wings, flies a little span, and flatters the brain: when a
man is in love then is he most pleased with himself; he
never imagined that for heights and depths, within an
apparently trite exterior, he was so remarkable a being;
and until the wave recedes he bestows a like approval
on the chance object who, in the prettiness of her hour,
or by some trick of manner, bulged his ego into grander
proportions.</p>

<p>Considering the issues, it was fortunate in many respects
that Fessenden had the inevitable attack so early in life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>He was subjected to an unmerciful chaffing, to the
most sarcastic achievements of Christina’s tongue, and
to more than one crude remark by Mr. Nettlebeck; in
subject the eternal damnation tendency of young fools to
fall in love with a bigger fool than themselves—in this
case as useless a bit of furniture as ever littered the
earth. Morris for a time ignored the episode, but after
Fessenden, who scorned his tormentors, overflowed one
day in the presence of the polite philosopher, and announced
that he intended to marry as soon as he had a
maple-grove of his own—college had no further charms
for him—the tutor and Nettlebeck had a long and meaning
conference. At its conclusion Morris spent an hour
in composition, the farmer hitched up his buckboard and,
in spite of the pressing duties of the season, drove thirty
miles to the station and gave the letter to an obliging
conductor to post in New York. Nettlebeck, not many
days later, took a trip which lasted nearly a week.</p>

</div>

<p>Fessenden, who had long since proposed to Grace and
been listlessly accepted, started as usual for the Hunters’
one evening, striking through the woods. The
moon illuminated the recesses, in which the snow still
lingered, and Fessenden strode along, idealizing even
that beautiful forest; for would it not, in another hour,
shelter two divinely selected beings? He still trod the
upper ether, but even in that rarefied atmosphere he
experienced a slight chill as he saw Jeff Hunter hastening
towards him through the romantic reaches.</p>

<p>Jeff, who under Fessenden’s training had acquired a
direct and uncompromising method of speech, wasted no
time in coming to the point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>“I’ve got bad news for you,” he announced. “Grace’s
gone, and she won’t come back, neither.”</p>

<p>Fessenden, who had a confused sense that he was
tumbling through space, merely stared at Jeff, who continued:</p>

<p>“Her ma came this morning and yanked her off—said
she’d have no such nonsense with a girl who was not
strong enough to darn her own stockings, let alone getten’
married. Grace cried, of course—all girls do whenever
they get an excuse—but soon dried up when her ma said
she’d take her out West and show her something of the
world. Grace told me to tell you she guessed it was all
right, she hadn’t felt much like getten’ married, anyway;
she’d only said yes because it wouldn’t have been
any use to say no; and the old lady told me to tell you
that it was no sort of use to follow her, for she was coverin’
up her tracks—she’s a tartar, that one, and I guess
you needn’t cry that you ain’t goin’ to have her for a
mother-in-law; and I guess she’s got enough money to
go ’s fur ’s she likes—she told me she’d be five hundred
miles away before night. As for Grace, Fess, she ain’t
worth one of the ribs in <i>Pocahontas</i>—that’s the reason
I didn’t warn you this morning.”</p>

<p>“Good-night,” said Fessenden.</p>

<p>The blood had rushed to his head. It remained there
and confused him, until, after a brief sleep, he awoke
next morning; then he burst in upon the astonished
Morris and raged like a madman. He smashed a window
and two chairs, vowed that he would walk to the
West, that he knew Grace loved him, and that if she
did not he had no use for life anyway.</p>

<p>Morris brought him partly to his senses by the ironic
method, to which Fessenden was peculiarly susceptible,
and then suggested that he put a sandwich in his pocket
and spend the day in the woods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>“When you are a rational being once more I shall be
glad to see you again and talk it over. I sincerely hope I
may be able to help you in some way. But we all have
to go through this, my boy. It is as inevitable as the
phenomenon of man and woman itself, and must be
taken as philosophically as the ills of the flesh, which
under the proper diffusion of scientific knowledge will be
obviated in time. It is to be hoped that puppy-love
will prove an equally amenable microbe. Now take to
the woods and think like a man.”</p>

<p>Fessenden took to the woods, but the time was not yet
come when he could think like a man. Calf-love has
furnished the mills of the wits since the first pen impaled
the emotions; but it may be a hideous experience to
youths in whom are the makings of strong and passionate
men. The academic standard arbitrarily established
by our literary powers has given the world an entirely
false idea of the American temperament, which, in its
masculine half, at least, is excitable and sentimental.
It is their capacity for intense and powerful emotion,
making them in mob capable of the maddest excesses of
enthusiasm, which is the deep indestructible bond of
unity in the American race; that has saved it from passing
off long since in fireworks; that, when it has found
the courage and acquired the brain-power to struggle
through its artificial envelope, will permit it to become
as great as it now thinks it is.</p>

<p>Poor Fessenden had not yet reached the analytical
stage. He went out into the forest and suffered horribly.
He wept and raved, and believed that so far as he was
concerned the world had reached its finish. For the
time he was primeval man balked of the first woman;
later, when the acute stage had passed, and imagination
had returned, every fine impulse and need of his nature
which had leaped to assertion under the quickening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
process of idealized woman seemed to have withered out
of him under the sudden blight. He felt shorn, impoverished,
hopeless; worse than all, helpless. To pursue
would be less than folly. Only a fortune and a detective
could have found the indifferent girl, hidden in the skirts
of a determined mother; and he had not a penny. The
little he made beyond what Nettlebeck charged him for
his board went, after the replenishment of his rough wardrobe,
to New York for books. His helplessness degraded
his manhood, added to the sum of his miseries. He
stood two days of this mental hell, during which he ate
little and slept less, and then he shouldered his axe and
put a sandwich in his pocket.</p>

<p>“I’m going over to the river to get a job driving logs,”
he said to Nettlebeck. “I’ve had fourteen years of this,
and I’d like a change for a week or two. When the logging
is over I’ll come home.”</p>

<p>The river was twelve miles distant. Ten minutes
after he had started on his tramp through the forest he
heard a shout behind him. He answered mechanically,
and a moment later was joined by Dolf.</p>

<p>“I thought I’d come along,” panted the younger Nettlebeck.
“I ain’t seen drivin’ for six years or so, and it’s
good exercise; you have to jump so lively.”</p>

<p>Fessenden shrugged his shoulders ungraciously, and
declined conversation, but even here he did not recognize
the ever-watchful spirit of his father. Nevertheless the
thought of that sympathetic parent spontaneously occurred
to him. He was the one person to whom he
could have spoken, but he remembered his fiercely reacting
pride at the age of thirteen; moreover, he was
bound to respect his father’s mandate of complete separation.
He had puzzled deeply over the motive which
had prompted this decision in a proud and affectionate
parent, but had finally put the question aside, as so far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
beyond his limited experience that he had better apply
his inquiring mind elsewhere. He had perfect faith in
both the wisdom and the love of his father, in spite of
occasional outbursts of disappointment, and although the
kind firm hand that guided his destinies and smoothed
his path without weakening his spirit was too well covered
to attract his attention, some spiritual emanation
from it kept his heart from closing and the bitterness
of neglect from entering his soul.</p>

<p>They reached the river in three hours, hearing from
the forest the roar of the dam, the loud shouts of the
men. On their side the woods grew down to the stream,
but on the heights opposite and far beyond hundreds of
virgin trees had been sacrificed that the people of New
York might have their daily news. The gates had just
been opened, the river was foaming and racing over the
rocks, its surface already crowded with long sections of
tree-trunks, while others were rolling down the hill.
The boss was short of men, and Fessenden and Dolf were
employed at once, for the logs were already becoming
jammed. Fessenden had watched “driving” many
times, and, jumping from log to log to avoid crushing his
feet, while at the same time he pried refractory logs into
position and relieved jams, he was soon so deeply occupied
learning his new trade, to say nothing of preserving
his bones, that Grace lay down among the memories. His
passion for proving himself the best man replaced the
other, and applying all his intelligence to the task, he
was very soon the most expert driver on the river. This
elated him and sent consoling rays through the dark recesses
of his soul. At night he was so tired that, after
the evening meal—a repetition of the two preceding ones
of pork, beans, bread, and coffee—he was asleep before he
had settled himself in his bunk; and although his spirit may
have wept over the hearse in the back alleys of his memory,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
for he awoke depressed and rebellious, he sprang out of
bed at once, ate his beans with a relish, and went to work.</p>

<p>As he tramped home at night two weeks later, he informed
himself that he was cured, and when he reached
his own comfortable bed he slept until late on the following
day; moreover, he enjoyed Christina’s savory dinner
with a relish which, as a rule, associates only with an
untroubled mind. Then he went for a stroll through
his favorite haunts of the forest—a guilty sense of disloyalty
had led him to avoid <i>Pocahontas</i> since the day
he met Grace—and it all came back. As it rushed upon
him, as he realized that he was still in bondage, he trembled
in panic. The horror of returning into the torments
of a fortnight since was as strong as the overwhelming
passion itself. He ran back to the house, the blood
pounding in his head, and searched the shelf over Fritz
Nettlebeck’s desk, where letters for the household and
neighbors awaited the leisurely claimant.</p>

<p>There was nothing for him; and then he realized that,
subconsciously, he had expected Grace to defy her
mother and write to him—had believed the separation
to be a matter of a few weeks; that the time would come
when her demand would be as imperative as his own.
He leaped up the stairs to his room and rummaged
among the papers on his table; there were fragments of
exercises in five languages, dead and alive, brief studies
of public men, but there was no letter, even from his
father. He returned to the forest, his hands and knees
trembling, his brain whirling, his panic increasing, muttering
vague phrases, filled with terror of the future,
confusion, a mad desire for annihilation. Then, as his
ego reached its depths and grovelled there, he straightened
himself suddenly and, flinging his fist against a
tree, exclaimed: “By God, what slavery!” What he had
seen of religion as expressed by itinerant and ignorant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
preachers had left him cold, but he had entire faith in
some great force pervading the Universe, although he did
not think it worth while to apply a name to it. He bethought
himself of this force, and by a violent effort put
himself in relation with it, demanding imperiously that
some of its strength should pass into him and relieve
him from this intolerable state of slavery. His prayer
was answered so quickly that for a moment he stood as
dazed as if he had been transferred abruptly to another
planet. Then he shrugged his shoulders, laughed at his
recent self, went down to the lake, and took <i>Pocahontas</i> out
for a long, confidential, and somewhat cynical conversation.</p>

<p>He half expected that the obsession would return, but
it did not, even when, missing his agonies, he endeavored
to evoke their ghosts. Finally he sat down and wrote a
long letter to his father.</p>

<p>“It has taught me two things,” he concluded: “the
advisability of keeping a tight hold on the bulk of your
energies until you are sure of having found the right
woman, and the danger of praying for strength to annihilate
unless you are quite sure you are not making a
mistake. In this case it was all right, but she might
have been the one woman; there might have been merely
a misunderstanding, and the result would have been the
same. I dragged the strength from out there into myself
and blasted the thing to the roots. I am convinced
that I can evoke that strength whenever I will, but it
rather frightens me to think that I might have made
this discovery at the wrong time.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">XI</h3>
</div>

<p>The immediate results of Fessenden’s enslavement and
deliverance were a terror of women, which he called contempt,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
an augmented interest in the great men of history,
and a daily mounting ardor for his country. He
had the usual school-boy’s idea of the isolated grandeur
of the American Republic, and a corresponding resentment
against the rest of the world for having annoyed it
occasionally. Mr. Abbott, who liked all healthy manifestations
in a youth, had asked Morris to let him keep
his illusions until he was old enough to accept their loss
without bitterness. Fessenden, who had been patriotic
enough in all conscience before he met Grace, now burned
with a holy fire, built an altar in the depths of the forest,
and solemnly devoted his life and energies to the service
of the United States—thought of her, dreamed of her,
poured upon her all the rejected passion of his nature.
But as yet no light had been shed upon the manner in
which he should best serve her, and one day he abruptly
broached the subject to Morris. The tutor came to attention
at once. He had been in correspondence with
Mr. Abbott for some time, and was awaiting his opportunity
to speak: Fessenden was a delicate subject.</p>

<p>“I have been thinking it over,” he said. “Of course
your father’s wish—and mine—has been that you should
go to Harvard, but in the few years since I left college
things have changed so in America—I am not old as
years go, and judging from the occasional newspaper and
magazine that comes my way, the world seems to have
run by me.” He spoke hesitatingly, as if the subject
had been presented to him too abruptly, after all; and
Fessenden, who did not count patience among his virtues,
beat a roll-call on the window-pane. The woods
were green and warm; <i>Pocahontas</i> was making imperious
little motions on the lake. A hint, a stimulus, was
all he expected from Morris; the final solution would be
found in solitude.</p>

<p>“Why not Harvard?” he asked, as Morris continued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
to look out upon the world in mute reproach. “Of
course I expect to go to Harvard. And my father says
the world’s all right.”</p>

<p>“Whatever is is right. I am philosopher enough to
believe that—but this is the point: the great universities,
like Harvard, are for the sons of rich men, or at all
events for those of that privileged class who do not have
to enter into the great struggle the moment they graduate.
If you had even a small income, and purposed to
become a man of letters, if you had in you the makings
of a professor or a clergyman, I should say Harvard without
hesitation, even though you would have to skimp
through in a manner that is very humiliating to a gentleman;
but I have studied you closely now for seven
years, and I cannot associate you with any of the old-fashioned
callings. You are peculiarly energetic and
practical. You have tremendous ideals, but you would
never have the patience to angle for them in an ink-pot,
and you have too much common-sense to stump the
world as a propagandist. The way for you to achieve
great ends is through the medium of money—no one in
this country to-day respects anything as much—and
through that medium you could make yourself understood
at once, and have what following you chose. It
seems to me that you could make money in very large
amounts—you were born with concentration, obstinacy,
and industry; you must excel in all you undertake or
burn to ashes in the attempt, and you have an uncommonly
good brain. Of course I have only been able
to cultivate its intellectual part, and there are a thousand
things you must study in the next few years—men,
your country, other countries, the great industrial, financial,
commercial, and political problems which make
up the machinery of the world. Now, if you were merely
to be a dilettante in these matters, I should again say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
Harvard; but as it seems to me that you were born to
take an active part in the great world problems, and as
you have your living to make, I have thought it expedient
to suggest the University of the Northwest—”
He paused again and turned away his head; the polite
scholar loathed the thought of the Western college. As
Fessenden stared at him in earnest attention, he proceeded,
in a moment.</p>

<p>“It is quite a remarkable institution in a way, and very
cheap. As it is in a small Western town, living costs next
to nothing; and as it is not patronized by rich men’s
sons, the scale of living is very low—there are no expensive
clubs and other constant demands. Of course it is
your duty to consider this, as well as the more complete
freedom which it would give you. It is my private
opinion that the great colleges are no place for a man
who cannot spend money like a gentleman. If my
father had lost his money earlier I should not have gone
to Harvard.”</p>

<p>“Well, what should I get at this Western university
that would send me straight from the log-cabin to Aladdin’s
cave—it used to be the White House.”</p>

<p>“That is what you would decide after you had been
there a year or two. The point is that you would find
there special courses on electricity, mechanics, banking,
transportation, agriculture, international relations, politics,
all the industrial problems. Through some one of
these great modern avenues you will make your way to
wealth, and you will have the inestimable advantage of
starting from the ground up—of mastering, for instance,
all the details of a machine-shop, of an engine, of railway
tracks, of the progressive development of that
most mysterious of all forces, electricity, while your
mind is still plastic. There is still another reason for
making yourself familiar with all these things while you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
are young and enthusiastic—even if you happened to
make your money in some field outside them all.” He
hesitated again, but proceeded almost immediately, and
in the tone of a man resolute to pursue any subject as
far as analysis would take him. “Suppose, for instance,
you should make a very great fortune, modern conditions
would place you in the most complex relations
with all the subjects which this university specializes.
You would be elected upon the boards of companies
without end, perhaps become president, vice-president,
of others; and, as a rule, directors know next to nothing
of the industries over which they preside; employers
know too little of what is <i>a b c</i> to the men under them.
Railroad presidents cannot know too much about mechanics
and electricity if they want to pay heavier dividends
than their rivals—in a word, it is the millionaire
who knows most of those subjects of which most millionaires
know nothing who rules all the other millionaires.
You see, I have let my imagination run away with me—I
already saw you aloft on a gold pedestal. Perhaps
I am too sanguine for you—one dreams much when one
lives the solitary life—”</p>

<p>“The millionaire proposition seems to me a good deal
of a come-down after all my fine dreams and ambitions,
but if it’s the short cut— I haven’t much patience— Is
money really so easy to make?”</p>

<p>“There is nothing less easy to make. My argument is
that you are one of the few who could make it if you
would.”</p>

<p>“Well, the harder the better. I wouldn’t give a red
cent for anything that could be had for the asking.”</p>

<p>Again Morris turned his head and stared into the fire.
He heartily wished that Mr. Abbott had come up and
done his own talking.</p>

<p>“Your life is likely to be strenuous enough,” he said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
after a pause. “When you are rich—if you ever are—you
will work as hard, if not harder, than before. Will
you think over what I have said about this university,
and write to your father? He told me once that he
should leave the matter to you; but, of course, he must
know soon, as you could enter any college this autumn.”</p>

<p>“I do not need to think it over. How long do you suppose
it takes me to make up my mind? I shall go to the
Western University.”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">XII</h3>
</div>

<p>He started early in September, accompanied by Morris,
who now confessed that he had long pined for the orange
groves, the perpetual sunshine of southern California;
and as far as the station by the stoical but cheerless
Jeff. Christina embarrassed him by a farewell embrace
and a tear, while promising him a monthly box of good
things. Morris requested him to take no clothes but those
he was obliged to wear, but he stuffed his sweaters among
his books; he could imagine himself permanently in no
less elastic envelope. In spite of remonstrance he also
packed his axe. He was quick and eager for the change,
and, with the ingratitude of man, left even <i>Pocahontas</i>
with little reluctance; his imagination pictured the great
gates of the world at the foot of the Adirondacks; and at
last he was to pass through them and into that infinite
beyond where all dreams were realities.</p>

<p>Morris had chosen the night train for obvious reasons;
and when they reached the station in New York he
hurried his young mountaineer into a cab and drove to
the best of the tailors, who met the immediate demand.
The necessary autumn and winter wardrobe he bought
for his charge called forth a vigorous remonstrance;
Fessenden had never imagined such reckless extravagance;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
but when his mentor had reassured him, he further
indulged himself in several sweaters. He was the
proud possessor of a hundred dollars, made in sugar, and
his fingers tingled with the new pleasure of spending.</p>

<p>From the shop they drove directly back to the station
to catch the morning train for the West. Fessenden
grumbled, for he wanted to see New York; every nerve
had sprung to greet the great city, and he hung out of
the cab in spite of remonstrances and to the amusement
of passers-by.</p>

<p>“I know how you feel,” said Morris. “I should like
it myself, but I dare not linger in New York an hour—its
air is fatal to me—so near the Atlantic—you will see
enough of New York in the future—I am sure you will
not mind.” And Fessenden submitted with what grace
he could muster. As they were standing in the station
awaiting the announcement of their train, Fessenden, to
the alarm of Morris, suddenly darted from his side and
disappeared in the crowd. Morris suspected the cause
and turned pale with anxiety. The color the mountains
had given him came back as he saw his charge returning
alone. Fessenden’s face, however, was flushed, his eyes
were as bright as tears.</p>

<p>“I saw my father!” he exclaimed, with a complete disregard
of the bystanders that was quite superb. “I
know I saw him! Why does he act like this? I was sure
he would come to meet me. Why should he look at me
and go away?”</p>

<p>“It could not have been Mr. Abbott,” said Morris
soothingly, and taking his arm he hurried him through
open gates. “It is doubtful if he is in New York,
and he is not the man to do anything so silly and sentimental.
He is very busy working out some idea which
requires all his energies—he dares venture upon no distraction—there,
I have told you that much—your unerring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
instinct has kept you from doubting that he loves
you.”</p>

<p>“Is he an inventor?” asked Fessenden eagerly. “Is
that the mystery? Is that the reason he wants me to
study all these new things—that I may be of use to
him?”</p>

<p>“Well, he is something of an inventor, and you certainly
can be of great use to him—more than anybody
on earth can be.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell me that before? Now I have
a double object. I’ll work like a logger. What’s his
line?”</p>

<p>Morris groaned; but as he disposed his hand-baggage
neatly about him he had another inspiration. “All!”
he announced. “That is to say, a combination of all
this very modern university can teach you. The result
may be extraordinary.”</p>

<p>Fessenden fell back on his seat and stared out of the
window, seeing nothing. His imagination was fired
with the vision of his lonely potential devoted father
experimenting in obscurity with a revolutionizing idea,
whose bare elementary threads—awaiting himself in the
Northwest—filled him with such excitement and exhilaration
that he wanted to get out and race the train.
Fortunately his deep emotions always rendered him
speechless, and Morris was permitted to sleep peacefully
during the greater part of the journey.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">XIII</h3>
</div>

<p>Although Morris had never reached the heart-strings
of his pupil, the youth was his one human interest—his
father was dead long since; and as Fessenden fully
realized his debt of gratitude to the capable and conscientious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
tutor, as well as being a person in whom habit
struck long roots, the parting was unexpectedly affecting.
As Fessenden returned from the station of the
little town of Turbine, where he was to spend the greater
part of the next four years, he suddenly conceived a
violent antipathy for his new surroundings, and a desire
to flee back to his mountains. This flat interminable
prairie, this cheap town, not an elevation in sight, much
less the mountains which had gone far into the modelling
of his nature—there was nothing here resembling the
great world of which he had dreamed. He longed for
real solitude, feeling for the first time the miserable substitute
the crowd offers; and suddenly understood how
much closer to the great realities of life it brings a man
than any actual juxtaposition.</p>

<p>But in a few days he was too busy and interested for
either homesickness or dreams. Morris had drilled him
so thoroughly in English, the dead languages, German,
French, in history and mathematics, that he could have
entered Yale or Harvard with sails spread, and in the
younger university he took a rank at once which gave
him the more time for the course known as “Training for
Business.” Almost immediately it seemed to him that
sleeping things rose in his brain, things whose existence
he had never suspected, and strove to put themselves in
touch with inspiring forces without. Fessenden, who
had made up his mind to place himself in a neutral receptive
state, to give no more thought to the future and
to ambition until he had learned all that the university
could teach him, was some time recognizing that these
new-comers were talents, and that they responded to all
that was inventive and practical in his initial course.</p>

<p>He recognized them in time, however, as day by day
he grew more absorbed in the mysteries of the engine
and electricity; and the glimpses he had, in his first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
year, of finance and political economy stirred him like
old love-letters. His imagination idealized and personified
the engine he worked upon as it had his canoe;
and on the day when he finally mastered the difficult
art of taking it to pieces and putting it together again
without help or hitch, he challenged the strong man of
the college to combat, and polished him off with such
enthusiasm that once more he occupied the proud position
of champion. This satisfied his masculine vanity,
besides delivering him from the chaffing and petty persecutions
provoked by his mountain hues; he was henceforth
permitted to indulge his passion for sweaters and
old hats, even on Sundays, unchallenged, while his remarkable
abilities were as frankly acknowledged.</p>

<p>The military drill did not give him enough exercise,
and he had promised his father he would waste no time
on sport. “Your passion to excel,” Mr. Abbott had
written, “would make you neglect your studies; so be
wise and get your exercise some other way.” Fessenden
was feeling nervous and somewhat confused one
Friday afternoon when he suddenly bethought himself
of his axe. He brought it forth, fingered it lovingly in
a rush of memories, then shouldered it and started for
the open country. He was not long finding a farmer
who was willing to have his wood cut for nothing, and
thereafter Fessenden spent an hour every evening and
half of Saturday, either felling Mr. Lunt’s trees or sawing
his logs; and the exercise relieved his brain and kept
his muscles hard.</p>

<p>The military drill not only dismissed his mountain
slouch and gave him a free and upright carriage, but inspired
him with dreams of war and glory. The martial
music quickened his blood, and secretly he fancied himself
very much in his uniform. It was not long before
he became restless in the ranks and announced to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
West Point officer in charge his desire to become captain.
The officer stared, laughed, then reminded him
that military rank was—as a rule—or should be (he was
a victim of politics himself), the result of superior accomplishments
and talents, to say naught of hard work.
Thereafter, three times a week during two of the afternoon
hours, Fessenden dismissed books and machinery
from his brain and concentrated that energetic instrument
upon military drill alone.</p>

<p>But he spent the greater part of his time and thought
in the shops and yards. Aside from the ambition and
the superabundant energy which prompted him to excel
in all he undertook, his imagination was absorbed in the
rapture of unravelling certain mysteries of science—was
at work on far-distant but great and picturesque
results. He was in no hurry to invent, but even while
signalling and switching at night he saw trains of unimaginable
beauty and grace and lightness skim by in
the dark, and great fleets of ships, invincible and terrible
in war, forcing the Monroe Doctrine down the throat of
Europe, perhaps annexing the rotten old monarchies
altogether. That the red hair of a daughter of the
Cæsars would one day entangle itself in his wondrous
electrical stores, and jerk them far afield, he did not
forebode then, poor Fessenden; he was happy in his
dreams and ideals.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">XIV</h3>
</div>

<p>As the college year was drawing to its close he received
the following letter from his father:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Boy</span>,—I am sorry to be obliged to inform you that
you must manage somehow to pay your own expenses during
the remaining three years at the university. Five hundred dollars
a year are a good deal, and you are younger than I am, remember.
I can let you have a hundred, but that is all, and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
have every confidence that you will be able to make the rest for
yourself. Perhaps you may imagine what it means to me to
reflect that I have such a son to lean on in my old age! I know
of no man living that I envy. I am informed of your progress,
and I am proud of you beyond the power of any poor words of
mine to express.</p>

<p class="right">Your affectionate <span class="gap">      <span class="smcap">Father</span>.”</span></p>
</div>

<p>For the moment Fessenden was shocked and bewildered;
but not only did the subtlety of Mr. Abbott’s
letter begin its work at once, but his mettle flew to its
opportunity. He promptly turned to with that absolute
lack of doubt which, in a man well equipped, compels
success. There were a number of relatively wealthy
men in the university whose patriotism for the West
and contempt for the effete East had led them, or their
fathers, to patronize the home institution. Fessenden
imperiously persuaded these men that they needed a
course of practical lessons in forestry and longed for a
summer in camp in the Adirondacks not far from the
cooking of Christina. The summer was pleasant and
profitable for all, but particularly for Fessenden, who
found many hours to dream alone among his mountains
and into the sympathetic ear of <i>Pocahontas</i>. She was
haughty and evasive for several days after his enthusiastic
arrival, turned him over twice, and took advantage
of every abstraction to make for submerged stumps and
shore. But having made him sufficiently miserable,
she gradually restored him to favor, and the old happy
bond was re-established. But although he was glad of
the long hours of rest and of pondering over the world
of science into which he had been precipitated by the
intuition and foresight of his father, he was soon eager
to get back to the practical application. He returned
to the university with half the money he needed, and
he could easily make up the remainder by coaching.
The day after his return he walked out to Mr. Lunt’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
and announced his intention of living with him and paying
for his board with his axe, or in any other reasonable
manner. The farmer was taken aback, and somewhat
displeased at the idea of paying for what he had grown
accustomed to accept as his right; but finally admitted
the justice of Fessenden’s argument, especially as he had
no such enthusiast for hard labor on his farm. Shortly
after, Fessenden, in a burst of adolescent pride, returned
his father’s contribution, having persuaded his forestry
class that they needed private lessons in German, which
in truth they did, although they enjoyed the study of
Fessenden more. They never connected him with the
author of his being, but they thought him unique and
perennially interesting. Occasionally they marvelled at
his sublime audacity, a quality as a rule born of the easy
assurance of wealth and social position, particularly
when well-bred and unconscious; but they never got
beyond the conclusion that it was the result of an unusual
brain and a gift for leadership. That he should
become the captain of his company before the end of
his first year, and prove an ardent disciplinarian, did
not so much surprise them; but his talents were less
easy to account for, and those interested in heredity
approached him on the subject. Fessenden was determined
to keep his father’s secret, whatever it might be;
and as he could be diplomatic when diplomacy seemed
more advisable than throwing an impertinent man out
of the window, he sent the curious away with the impression
that he came of plain mountain people.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">XV</h3>
</div>

<p>During this year he took up modern history, the development
of railway intercourse in Europe and America,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
and pursued his studies and experiments of the previous
year with unabated ardor. He likewise became violently
interested in politics, and let off a good deal of steam
in public speaking. He also took up the cudgels for the
East, partly because his father was a New-Yorker, partly
because in this attitude he stood practically alone.
Privately he thought the West had cause for grievance
in the absurd and ignorant attitude of the East; but it
was impossible for him to run with the majority, and
there certainly was much to be said for the older civilization.
The question of strikes and all the manifestations
of the antagonism between capital and labor did not
engage his attention until the following year; and when
it did his sympathies were entirely with the poor man,
as he informed his father in long and impassioned letters.
In answer, Mr. Abbott invariably reminded him that as
yet he knew nothing of the rich, and advised him to
suspend judgment. But although Fessenden by this
time was an intolerant democrat, wore his oldest sweaters,
and even persuaded Miss Lunt to patch his trousers,
there was something curiously aristocratic in his attitude
and personality, which his associates felt rather
than analyzed. There was not a man in the college who
would have dared to emulate his utter disregard of appearance,
his indifference to comment on the streets of
Turbine, the catholicity of his acquaintance, the manner
in which he ignored the very existence of those he
did not like, the recklessness with which he thought out
loud, apparently unconscious that anything could affect
his standing, popularity, and reputation, and the indefinable
touch of patronage in his most extreme democracy.
And although even at that period, when he was
full of vanity, he did not swagger, still it was noticeable
that he carried himself as if the world were his. He
made enemies, but he either fought them or accepted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
them with philosophy, and he had an army of disciples,
who followed his imaginative flights and his most radical
theories to the bitter end.</p>

<p>But his fellow-men interested Fessenden less at this
period than the wonderful excursions he was making
daily into the new realms of thought and research. It
was during the middle of the third year that he gave himself
up more particularly to the study of finance, the development
of banking, and political economy. He pursued
these studies with a curious sense of reviving old
memories; he surprised himself at his love of dry details—that
even here his imagination saw picturesqueness in
the possibilities of concentrating vast sums of money and
yet filling the veins of a great country with a life-blood
of liquid gold. During his democratic madness he had
seriously doubted whether his conscience would permit
him to be a rich man; but now, with a chastened yet no
less sincere democracy, he made up his mind that for a
man of the people to acquire millions and then use them
for the amelioration of his less-gifted fellows, to say
nothing of glorifying his country, was both wise and
poetical. Having satisfied his mind on this point, he
astonished the university and Turbine by appearing at
church in a suit of clothes not only of harmoniously assorted
pieces, but manifestly made to order. He sustained
the balance by looking worse than usual during
the week.</p>

<p>In the vacation preceding Fessenden’s fourth year the
university received, from a source which was to remain
unknown to all but the president, a large bequest for
the departments of banking and finance. The bequest
was accompanied by the condition that during the ensuing
year certain eminent authorities were to be asked
to lecture. Somewhat to the surprise but greatly to the
satisfaction of the faculty, invitations to lecture were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
promptly accepted by the Secretary of the Treasury, the
President of the Pennsylvania Railroad, the owner of a
great department store, and three leading bank presidents.
These gentlemen did not confine themselves to
generalities; they described the practical workings of
their respective systems, enriched by a wealth of comparison
with corresponding systems in other countries;
they pointed out the defects and disadvantages of both
sides, and analyzed the causes of the remarkable progress
of so young a country as the United States; they emphasized
the necessity of a sleepless alertness, and the
demand for new ideas which should be bold without
recklessness and safe without conservatism. Fessenden
listened with tingling nerves and legs moving restlessly.
He wrote to his father that he regarded this
timely benefaction as a direct interposition of Providence
in his behalf, and that although he certainly had to work
harder than any one in the world, he believed that he had
been born under a star of remarkable magnitude. His
ambitions had revived long since. He had in his imagination
a union of steel and electricity so madly romantic
that he dared not confide even in his father. He must
make a large sum of money first, for he would trust no
one with his secret. He believed that he could make his
country invincible, the ruler, if she chose, of two hemispheres,
and he looked back somewhat patronizingly
upon his old heroes. Other times, other gods! The
pendulum in him was still swinging wildly, the balance
was not yet; but the depth and tenacity of purpose, the
clear creative intellect, quick and versatile in grasp, and
of an extraordinary energy; the high enthusiasm and
real capacity for the passion of patriotism were all modelling
and biding their time within the exterior made up
of their defects.</p>

<p>So passed the four years, with their intervals of mountain-life,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
when, in spite of his ever-increasing classes,
he drew renewed strength and courage from solitude
and the invigorating air of high altitudes. Hard
work told little on him, for his body was full of red
mountain-blood and clamped with magnificent muscles.</p>

<p>He hoped that his father would come and witness his
triumphs of Commencement Day, but he received this
letter instead:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Boy</span>,—It is a matter of very great regret to me
that I cannot be with you at this time, but I will explain my absence
to your entire satisfaction when we meet. Thank God
that will be almost immediately. At a very bitter price to myself
I have relentlessly pursued a plan conceived the day after
your mother’s death; and my compensation so far has been its
entire success. Will you come to New York on Monday? It
had been my intention to meet you in the Adirondacks and tell
my story there, for I dislike anything savoring of drama, but
business imperatively commands me to stay here, and I must
ask you to come to me. I have sent for <i>Pocahontas</i>. I enclose
a postal order for a hundred dollars. May I ask you not to arrive
in a sweater? New York is not Turbine. Moreover, a natural
weakness makes me wish to see you, after so many years, at the
best possible advantage.</p>

<p class="right">“Your very affectionate &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<br>

“<span class="smcap">Father</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>Fessenden pondered over this letter. It was enigmatic,
and Mr. Abbott’s brief communications were
usually remarkable for their clarity. He had made up
his mind four years ago that his father was an inventor,
and denuded him of all mystery. It also occurred to
him with startling abruptness that he had never seen his
father’s signature. As he stood staring at the paper,
shadowy images, impressions, chance words, blurred
pictures rose from some forgotten well in his mind, endeavored
to sharpen, to cohere; but they faded away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
impotently; the vital interests of the morrow rushed in
and claimed place; he shrugged his shoulders and sent
his father a telegram.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">XVI</h3>
</div>

<p>“Fess,” said Jeremiah Keene, on the night of Commencement
Day, “what are you going to do with yourself?
You are the most expansive—nay, sentimental
and emotional creature on one side of you, and on the
other the most secretive! I’ve turned myself inside out
to you over and over again. You know all my hopes,
aspirations, plans—who doesn’t? What have I been
digging away at this school of mines for? But you’ve
gone in for everything, distinguished yourself in pretty
nearly everything—and we are none the wiser. In
these days you’ve got to be one thing—one thing—there’s
no chance for any but the specialist, and you
are as well aware of that as any one else. So I know,
we all know, that you must have made up your mind—that
you know what you are about. It isn’t only curiosity
that prompts me to ask for your secret—there is
no necessity for maunderings on my part. I’d like to
know; we may not meet again for years—you go East,
I go West—I’ve never taken a liberty with you before;
forgive me this.”</p>

<p>Fessenden made no reply for a moment. He was
spending his last night in Turbine in the rooms of his
chum. The day had been crowded with triumphs. He
was dazzled, elated, a trifle bewildered. Compliments
and flattering predictions had fallen thick upon him.
The president had congratulated him publicly, invited
him to dinner to meet the distinguished guests, and he
had been the only student so honored. Among the
guests were several of the eminent men who had condescended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
to illuminate the university during the past
year, and they had singled out Fessenden and paid him
such marked attentions, besides interrogating him so
closely as to his interest in his more important studies,
that both faculty and students, highly as they thought
of their star, were astonished: the successful self-made
American takes very little interest in unmade futures.
It was a great and notable tribute to personality, and
Fessenden’s chest had risen and his head bulged more
than once. He was feeling his strength at every nerve-point,
he knew himself to be ready to go out and conquer
the world at once; his mind had flashed back during
the exciting day to the long course of training, from
his babyhood until this last week of his twenty-first year,
which had modelled his inherited forces in brain and
character, slowly and safely, given him the physical
endurance to keep pace with the restless energies of his
mind. He was filled with gratitude for his father, but
he also thought very well of himself. The self-made
American was his type, the ideal he had set on high;
whether born in a log-cabin, on a Virginia plantation, or
a romantic British isle, was immaterial. All the great
men of his country had started with a reasonable amount
of poverty, and certainly the youthful record of none
was more brilliant than his. He had had his disappointments,
his disillusionments, even in Turbine; he had been
deceived and tricked and tripped and hurt like all men;
but he lived too much in imagination, in the future, and
his application to study had been too severe for brooding
on the shortcomings of the world. He still thought
well of it, and his consistent admiration for his friend
Keene had gone far to nurse his optimism. Life never
did a kinder thing for him than in bestowing so abundant
a measure of contentment in these last hours of his
boyhood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>He stood up in a moment, turning over his chair.
Keene was lying on a divan, smoking. The lamp was
low. The windows were open, but to silence only. It
was very late.</p>

<p>“Well—well—well—” said Fessenden. “I don’t know.
I should have to tell you so much—and my ambitions
are defined and at the same time rather nebulous. You
see, I have to find out just what my father wants of me
first—what he is—”</p>

<p>“What he is? There is a mystery, then? You’ve
bluffed us pretty well.”</p>

<p>“I’m no maker of mysteries. I don’t know, myself—but—and
you’re the only person living I’d say this to,
and I’d break even your head if you gave a hint before
he was ready—I think he is a great inventor and wanted
me to have this training that I might help him.”</p>

<p>It was on the tip of Keene’s tongue to remark upon the
uselessness of Mr. Abbott’s secrecy so far as his son was
concerned, but congratulated himself a few moments
later that Fessenden had given him no time for comment.</p>

<p>“I have not seen him for years, but not through lack
of affection—he asked me to trust him and I have done
so. I had a curious letter from him on Tuesday—I have
thought a good deal about it since—and now that I am
to see him and know all so soon, I may permit myself to
indulge in curiosity. I’ll read it to you if you like.”</p>

<p>He held Mr. Abbott’s last letter to the lamp and read
it aloud; then plunged his hands into his pockets, planted
himself squarely on his feet, and told Keene of his
peculiar relations with his father since his mother’s
death. He made it all very vivid; the brief visits of Mr.
Abbott, the concise pregnant conversations, the firm
careful finger always modelling at the foundations of
his character, the cleverness and foresight with which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
his father had secured the services of Stanley Morris,
who through seven monotonous years had pined for
California. Much of this was revealed unconsciously in
the narrative of his mountain-life. While he was in the
midst of his story Keene sat up suddenly; a moment
later interrupted him to ask for a description of Mr.
Abbott. Fessenden had answered: “Small, thin, but
with an immense lot of presence—even up there where
one man is exactly the same as another, where there is
real equality and no bluff about it—they all bowed down
to him instinctively—even Morris, who is a deep scholar
and thinker and belongs to one of the best families in
the country—if you care for that sort of American rot.
Even when I was a little chap and he used to pet and
fondle me, I could feel the power come out of him, and
I told Morris once that if he wasn’t a rich man it must
be his own fault—he made you feel he could be anything
he chose. His face is beautiful to me, perhaps
because I love him, for Morris remarked rather nastily
once that he was not generally considered a beauty; but
he has eyes that can light up, and his face always changed
for me anyhow, if it did look rather cold—perhaps hard—at
other times. Nettlebeck swore once that it was
hard, but I never could see it. His features are well cut,
too, his nose looks as if it could go through a stone wall,
and there is not an indefinite curve in his mouth—there
you have him, as well as I can describe anybody.”</p>

<p>But Keene, long since, had rolled over and buried his
face in the sofa cushions.</p>

<p>The next day, as the two men parted at Chicago,
Keene, who was far more mature than Fessenden, having
less of the eternal boy in him, put his arm about his
friend’s shoulder and said hesitatingly: “Remember—there
are terrible disappointments awaiting you out
here in the great world—as for all of us. Take everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
that comes along as philosophically as you can—everything
is for the best, I suppose. Above all, don’t
let any shock embitter you. I am sure, I am sure that
your father is all that you imagine him to be—that whatever
he does in regard to you—has done—is right....
I wish he were not so poor, however; I wish he were
<i>the</i> Abbott.”</p>

<p>“Who is <i>the</i> Abbott?”</p>

<p>“Of course you never read the newspapers, and it is
odd how he manages to keep out of the illustrated magazines—I
should think he must pay them. The Abbott,
my dear boy, is richer than the whole Rothschild outfit
condensed into the singular.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad he’s not that sort of Abbott,” said
Fessenden indifferently. “Thank God I can show my
mettle and start from the ground up.”</p>

<p>The words left no trail in Fessenden’s mind; the parting
which followed affected him deeply, and he was too
excited at the prospect of seeing his father again to recall
what had impressed him as a mere chance remark.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">XVII</h3>
</div>

<p>As Fessenden left the train on Monday morning and
walked down the long crowded platform to the gates, he
was nervous and happy and sentimental, but full of
vanity. Not as the prodigal son was he returning to his
father after these long years of disunion. Had not a
telegram from the president of his university acquainted
Mr. Abbott with his son’s brilliant climax? Was he not
about to relieve his parent of all further worries and responsibilities,
to say naught of shedding lustre upon the
family name? He was sure that his father, if he had
chosen obscurity for his own portion, must still be in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
position to give him advice and immediate suggestion,
of more value than gold.</p>

<p>He had arrayed himself in a new suit of summer gray,
and with considerable satisfaction, for he had spasms of
personal vanity, although only death could separate
him permanently from the reprobates of his wardrobe.
His long body was still very slight, but it was muscular
and lithe. When his eyes were not hard or dreamy with
concentrated thought they were ready to laugh their response
into any friendly eyes they chanced to meet.
Although as a rule he would have scorned to admit that
he knew whether he was good-looking or not, he was in
so gay a mood this fine summer morning that he frankly
accepted admiring glances for what they were worth,
and was glad to add such attractions as his ancestors
had given him to the sum he was about to present to one
doting parent. Not that Fessenden was a handsome
boy; his present attractiveness lay for the most part in
his youthful armory of glancing and glinting expressions;
but his hair was brown and bright, his eyes were blue
and dark, and his features cut by race, not by chance.
In his most disreputable alliances with old clothes he
never lacked distinction, and to-day, in spite of the eager
restlessness of his muscles—he was seldom in repose—he
was very naturally mistaken by the calculating feminine
mind for a fledgling of the privileged class.</p>

<p>His progress in the dense crowd was slow, and his
stride was naturally long. It was not in him to submit
to impeded progress, and he jumped back into the train
and made his way rapidly to the front car. As he sprang
to the ground near the gates he saw his father’s pale
eager face, and he stiffened suddenly lest he utter a
mountain whoop or imperil his dignity in the feminine
manner. When he had forced his way beyond the barriers,
he nearly crushed Mr. Abbott’s firm bony hand,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
then pulled it through his arm and—started for Forty-second
Street.</p>

<p>“Come on! Come on!” he said through his teeth,
“we can’t say anything here.”</p>

<p>His father managed to steer him to the cab-stand, and,
as they drove down Madison Avenue, talked rapidly and
somewhat at random. It was evident that he was as
nervous as his son, but equally manifest that he was full
of paternal pride and delight. Fessenden gripped his
hand two or three times, incoherent, but happy in the
light of approval and the warmth of an affection so long
withheld.</p>

<p>The hansom stopped before an immense brown-stone
house on a corner, and Mr. Abbott descended, dismissing
the cab. Fessenden wondered, but assumed that his
father lived in a private hotel. It was his last moment
of density. As the door was opened by an elderly butler,
behind whom stood four footmen in livery, a band of
ghosts seemed to race past his inner vision; as he entered
the wide hall hung with tapestries, doors on the
right and the left showing the splendor of delicate brocade
and historic furnishing, his brain experienced a
sharp and clarifying shock. He had a dizzying vision
of a little boy, in the pride of his first trousers, flying
down those massive banisters and followed by a soft
protesting shriek. For a moment every part of the
house seemed to be pervaded by that small child and the
minor almost querulous chords of a long-forgotten voice.
His hand shook as he gave his hat to a footman of preternatural
dignity, as he met the stolid but recognizing
eye of the butler. He had not the courage to think,
and he was white and almost weak as he followed his
father to the library at the back of the house. It was a
great room, lifted bodily from a ducal castle—books,
pictures, busts, weapons—in the devouring American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
fashion. Fessenden, after one glance, fell into a chair
and covered his face with his hands. He had torn up
the papers on that table more than once, tobogganed
his father in the deep chair opposite.</p>

<p>Mr. Abbott seated himself in the chair and grasped
the arms firmly. His face was more sallow than usual,
but his glance was unwavering. “I see that you are
already beginning to suspect—to know,” he said. “I
will not insult you by circumlocution, but make my
confession at once—”</p>

<p>Fessenden emerged suddenly from his lethargy, sprang
to his feet, and glared down upon his father. His eyes
were almost black, his nostrils were jerking, and the
pallor under his tan made him look quite ferocious.
“What is there to say?” he almost shouted. “I can
see the cursed truth plainly enough. You are a rich
man.”</p>

<p>His father met his glare steadily. “I am the richest
man in the world,” he said.</p>

<p>Again Fessenden was inarticulate, and under this
merciless assault even his anger fell. He stared at his
father with paling eyes and coloring face.</p>

<p>“Sit down, will you not? I have a great deal to
say.”</p>

<p>Fessenden, bewildered with the knowledge that he
stood on the threshold of an unknown world which even
now mocked his years of strenuous endeavor, resumed
his chair mechanically and fixed his eyes on his father’s
face that he might make sure he was hearing facts at
least. The flattering attentions of the university guests
suddenly arose in his memory, and he writhed in self-abasement.
He felt the floor with the heel of his boot
to ascertain if it were secure beneath his feet.</p>

<p>“I suppose I had better begin at the beginning,” said
Mr. Abbott. “I saw little of your mother after the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
year of our marriage. She was born in the world of
fashion, was a natural and determined leader; and
shortly after your birth she entered upon a career of
extravagance which has seldom been equalled even in
this town. It was a matter of indifference to me how
much money she spent so long as she was contented—she
was badly spoiled—and as she was a beautiful and
clever creature I was very proud of her; moreover, too
busy to regret that she had so little time for me. Perhaps
I should go back a step further here and tell you
that my father was also a man of large wealth—for his
day—and of great importance in the banking world. I
was trained as his successor from my earliest years, and
fortunately took to it naturally. In those days the sons
of rich men were more serious than they are now; but
I sowed a few wild oats before I settled down, and, being
of a delicate constitution, they permanently impaired
my health. This fact will enable you more readily to
understand my course in regard to you.</p>

<p>“But to return to your mother. Naturally she spoiled
you—badly! You were never permitted to draw a
breath of fresh air except in fine weather; you had whatever
you cried for. There was every prospect that you
would grow up—if you survived childhood—the average
nervous dyspeptic American—worse still, the average
worthless rich man’s son. The day after her death, as
I sat alone here in this room, with you playing on the
hearth-rug, I had an inspiration, and determined at once
to act upon it. I had known the Nettlebecks for many
years; I was in the habit of going into camp with several
of my friends not far from their farm. Only Fritz, who
acted as our guide, knew that I was a rich man, and I
knew his capacity for silence. I had a sudden vision
of all you might become in that magnificent air, raised
by frugal but well-living Germans, who would obey my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
orders to the letter—removed from all the debilitating
influences and the temptations of wealth—well! I did
not wait to communicate with Nettlebeck. I whisked
you off the day after the funeral, and without warning
to grandmothers and aunts. I made Nettlebeck an offer
which he accepted promptly, swore him to secrecy,
and left you in that wilderness as elated as if I had
scooped up Wall Street, hard as it was to leave you.
Later came the fortunate episode of my conversation
with Stanley Morris’s father—”</p>

<p>Fessenden interrupted him with a sharp exclamation.
“He, too, was in the plot! You chose your tools well. I
never received a hint.”</p>

<p>“Morris knew all. It is quite true, however, that he
was the son of an old college friend, suddenly impoverished,
and that it was necessary for him to live in a
peculiar atmosphere. He was bent upon California, but
I offered him five thousand a year to live at the Nettlebecks’
and prepare you for college; also twenty-five
thousand dollars the day you entered. He did not hesitate;
moreover, I gave him carte blanche at the best
bookshops of New York and Boston, and offered to send
to Europe for anything which was not imported through
the regular channels—”</p>

<p>“In other words, you bought him body and soul!
Well, he was not much of a man, anyhow. And no
wonder he was so well fitted to impress me with the
value of money!”</p>

<p>“I have bought bigger men than Morris,” said Mr.
Abbott dryly. “I own twenty-eight members of Congress,
seven of the most imposing figure-heads of the
British aristocracy, one sovereign, and several minor
presidents. But to proceed. So far, I have given you
only my paternal reasons for your bringing-up. I will
say little now of what the separation meant to me. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
had never been too busy to play with you, had haunted
the nursery or had you brought down here during every
hour I could snatch for home. As I saw you improve
up there in the mountains, from a charming but sickly
baby into such a sturdy, bright, manly little chap, it
took all the will I possessed to leave you behind me
when I returned. At last the effort cost too much, and
I dreaded failure. I took the drastic course and saw
you no more. The day you left New York for the West
I stole a glimpse of you at the station. Since then I
have not seen you until to-day. During this last year
others have shared my secret besides Morris and Nettlebeck—the
president of your university and the close
personal friends whom you know only as prominent
men who agreed to lecture on the subjects which happened
to absorb you. They were tremendously interested
in my experiment, and, as they are men who owe
their success in life as much to their talent for keeping
their mouths shut as to anything else, I had no fear that
they would betray me. As for the president, of course
I knew I could trust him fully. But enough of this personal
side. I had another object in preserving you from
the pitfalls, the physically and mentally debilitating influences
of wealth, which I should have pursued had I
been twenty times less a father. You were my only son,
you must carry on the traditions of our house, become
the custodian of millions, of the vast power they entailed—”</p>

<p>“And suppose your method has done its work too
well,” cried Fessenden, setting his jaw exactly as his
father did while he listened to his angry son. “You
know something of the results of your—your intrigue,
but not all. You know that I have developed strength,
power, but not how much. You see only the obstacles
I have conquered; you know nothing of the ambition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
that discipline of yours has developed in me—the inspirations
of lives of men of not dissimilar—so far as I knew—beginnings.
And now! Good God, I feel like a mountebank!”</p>

<p>“Answer this question, and not too hastily: Have I
done you an injustice? Nothing could alter the fact that
I was a rich man. Do you regret that I did not run the
risk first of your becoming a sickly spoiled brat, then a
dissipated fool? A few, a very few sons of rich men in
this country have turned out passably well—never what
their fathers were: circumstances did not compel them
to or go to the wall; and I dared not tell you—the risk
was too great. I could see no other way; and, looking
back, I see none now.”</p>

<p>Fessenden rose and mechanically started for the log
in the grate, but it was June, and he kicked a stool instead.
He was still seething; but even so, his sense of
justice dominated his desire to indulge to the full his
bitter indignation and disappointment. “No,” he said,
after a moment, “you were right enough. Doubtless
in time I shall be duly grateful to you. But that premonition
does not mitigate in the faintest degree what
I feel now.” His eyes met his father’s, which were
full of affection and pride, and he suddenly descended
a peg or two. “I don’t mind telling you, sir—I believe
you will not laugh at me—but I felt—conceited
ass that I was—that I was destined to become a great
man. I felt it was in me to accomplish anything, be
anything I set my brains upon. Of course it was all
red blood—the result of precocious development in solitude,
of the little successes which your watchful care
enabled me to win; but the result was the same as if it
had been the real thing. I feel like a peacock with its
tail pulled out. And now please tell me what it has all
been for. You say you need a strong man—is that necessary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
for the custody of millions? An ordinary sober
honest hard-working agent could do as well, I should
think; you must have some estimable relatives.”</p>

<p>Mr. Abbott laughed. “Not suitable for my purpose,”
he said. “Sit down. I have still much to say. I never
blinded myself to the fact that I was running a great
risk, my dear boy; that you might get far beyond me,
refuse to conform to my ultimate plans—especially after
you realized that I not only had been obliged to act a
lie but to utter more than one. One source of my great
power is that my word has never been questioned, and
I can manipulate Wall Street by a simple statement. I
may add that my word is as unchallenged in Europe.
I have bitter enemies, and they have called me every
opprobrious epithet except liar. But for once I determined
to play the Jesuit; and as you have as truthful
and honest a nature as one meets here below, I will add
that the man who cannot lie when some great issue is at
stake is too big an ass for this world. Well, to proceed.
It does not so much matter about the destiny of the
average millionaire’s wealth; it is usually cut up among
relatives and benefactions—bids for immortality in the
third degree. At the worst it can be left in trust. But
when I follow my father, only ten millions will go to—to—relatives.
You must be the custodian of the bulk;
and when I give you its present figure—reminding you
that such wealth rolls up wealth unceasingly, by the
mere force of momentum—it may dawn upon you that
you still have it in your power to become as great and
as mighty as ever your boyish imaginings dictated, and
that you will need all the character you have put in storage.
What is your idea of a great fortune—an American
fortune?”</p>

<p>“I have thought very little about it. A million seems
to me a huge sum. I have heard of fortunes of fifty or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
sixty millions—I have scarcely believed in them, although
I perfectly comprehend the wealth of nations. I
am now prepared to hear you say you are worth anything.”</p>

<p>“I am worth four hundred millions.”</p>

<p>Fessenden gasped. The distant rumble of the streets
came to his sensitive ears like the sound of crashing
worlds. In a moment he laughed. “Go on,” he said.
“I anxiously await the dawn, the arrival of hope. I
am utterly incapable of grasping such a sum. Have
you got it in gold coin in the bank? If you could show
it to me in that concrete form I might realize it—not
otherwise.”</p>

<p>“You will realize it when you have spent several
months examining my papers; and when this natural
bewilderment has passed you will recall all you have
recently mastered of banking and finance. You can lay
your hands on several millions in gold coin if you desire—and
transfer them to your own account, for that
matter; no wish of yours will ever again be ungratified
by me. But the greater part represents the controlling
interests in the leading corporations, industries, and railroads
in this country, to say nothing of real estate, government
bonds—of which I have the largest share of
any man or combination of men—and the bank of which
I am the president and principal shareholder. That is
the skeleton; the details require weeks of explanation
on my part and close application on yours. I have told
you enough to demonstrate to you that the day approaches
when you may be the most powerful man in
the world if you choose. You will have heard that the
Rothschilds dictate to Europe—that a nation may be
unable to go to war if they refuse to advance the money.
What the Rothschilds are as a family I am as an individual—and
doubly so, for I can act on the moment; I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
am obliged to consult no one. When the coffers of the
United States Treasury are low I can fill them; if I refused,
and lifted my warning finger to others, they
would remain empty. I can reduce the President of
this great country to a mere figure-head. When the
right moment comes I can push the United States into
the front of nations, or force it to continue to play a
third-rate part. In time I can—and shall—make her
the most powerful, the most feared, the most hated of
all the countries on the globe—through such a concentration
of capital as no one at the present moment has
had more than a tantalizing dream of. Fifteen years
from now this country will not only be the clearinghouse
of the world, but the autocrat of commerce. Do
you begin to see light?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the dawn breaks; but by your leave I will go to
my own room for a while. My brain must have a brief
respite. Where am I to hang out?”</p>

<p>“The corner suite on the third floor. I have had a
swimming-tank put in, a Russian bath, and a gymnasium.
What you don’t like you will change, of
course.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. I shall probably put a cot in the gymnasium.”</p>

<p>“Don’t fear that I am stifling you with luxury.
I have my idea of what a man’s rooms should be,
and I doubt if you find that it differs from your
own.”</p>

<p>As Fessenden opened the door he turned with a sudden
flash in his eyes. “Where is my sister?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“She is visiting the Archduchess Ranata Theresia,
daughter of the Emperor—”</p>

<p>But Fessenden had closed the door with force and was
bounding up the stair. “Good God!” he thought, “is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
the world I am to live in made up of superlatives? I
feel like Gulliver fallen upon Brobdingnag.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">XVIII</h3>
</div>

<p>He found no fault with his rooms. They were not
those of a poor student with a great future, but they
were severe, masculine, and entirely adequate. When he
had taken a cold swim in his marble tank, and exercised
for half an hour in his gymnasium, the blood which his
father’s millions had shocked to his brain receded and
left it clear and logical again. But he was by no means
reconciled to his lot; he feared the stifling influences of
wealth, of which he had read in so many books. To
make a great fortune in constant warfare with all the
difficulties, acquiring a painful knowledge of the value
of every dollar, was an achievement which might easily
lead to greater accomplishment still, but to fling a man
on his back without warning and pour gold over him by
the ton—</p>

<p>He left his room abruptly and walked slowly downstairs.
“What’s the use of thinking about it? or about
what was to have been?—my absurd impossible past,
which I shall put away in lavender and cherish like a
dead love. There is nothing to be done but to make the
best of a bad business, re-adapt myself—mortals are
always doing that, anyhow. I shall ask for a respite
before settling down to it, however.”</p>

<p>When he reached the main floor he turned into the reception-room
and strolled through the several large and
lofty rooms which ended in a music-room of immense
proportions. He inferred that it was the largest in New
York; and, still feeling sore and satirical, returned to a
more appreciative inspection of the other rooms. That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
their harmonies were exquisite he needed no telling, and
he thought the pale soft tints, as faded and elusive as
charming old memories, a pleasant contrast to his beloved
Nature. That the few pictures were as great in
art as they must be in price he also knew instinctively,
and found consolation in the reflection that his father
did not belong to the class of millionaires who furnished
with a single check and leaned upon the agent and the
decorator. The rich worn oddly built furniture looked
as if brooding in cold aloofness upon an historic past,
yet not wholly dissatisfied with its present. Where there
were no pictures, bits of brocade, which looked as if a
breath might waft them in search of their makers, had
been inserted with such skill that they were a part of the
background of tarnished gold. Not a chair, not a table,
not a cabinet, was formed like anything Fessenden had
ever seen, and there were numberless objects for which
he had no name; but he approved of everything; indeed,
they gave him a distinct pleasure—caressed the raw
edges of his resentment, and inclined his mind more
philosophically to his new condition.</p>

<p>When his eye had mastered the general effect, it took
note of the exceeding repetition of one object, the photograph
of a girl. There were perhaps twenty of these
large photographs in the different rooms, framed in
silver, in gold, in brilliants, in semi-precious stones, on
tables, on easels, on shelves. One massive gold frame,
incrusted with jewels, bore aloft the double eagle of the
House of Hapsburg. Across all these pictures was dashed,
rather than written, the name <span class="smcap">Ranata</span>, followed by an
inscription in German, French, English, or in another
language for which Fessenden had no name. The girl
herself was taken in full, in profile, on horseback, sitting
in throne-like chairs, leaning on balustrades, at any age
from ten to eighteen, and in as many different costumes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
as there were photographs. Fessenden sniffed at the
vanity of woman, but concluded that he had never seen
such a seat in the saddle, and that she certainly looked
as if she knew her own mind. Whether he admired her
or not he was unable to determine. She had an antique
profile, and her eyes were as American as his own—shrewd,
alert, eager, powerful. One of the photographs
was colored, and the hair blazed, but the eyes were gray.
Fessenden thought it romantic to have a princess in the
family, and examined the pictures with much interest.
The greater number had been given to her much-loved
Alexandra, but one was apparently the property of his
father, and another of a Mrs. Abbott, of whom he knew
nothing. He was not the youth to fall in love with a
photograph, however, and as he walked towards the library
the Archduchess Ranata Theresia made way in his
mind for other matters which at that stage concerned
him far more deeply.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">XIX</h3>
</div>

<p>His father was standing on the hearth-rug, awaiting
his return with some uneasiness. Fessenden gave his
hand a mighty grip. “It’s all right,” he said. “I was
born into this family, and that is the end of it. I’d
never go back on you, anyhow. But if you don’t mind,
I’d like to go up to the mountains for a while. I’d like
it awfully if you would come, too, of course—it’s only
that I can think better there than anywhere else—and it
occurs to me for the first time that I am rather tired—the
examinations were very stiff, and I went in for an
unusual amount.”</p>

<p>“The Adirondacks, by all means, if you prefer them;
and I am badly in need of a holiday; but how would you
like a yachting cruise for a change? I have a new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
steam-yacht of 7000 tons that I think would interest—”</p>

<p>“A steam-yacht of 7000 tons!” cried Fessenden, his
terrible responsibilities forgotten. “I can think of nothing
on earth—what sort of machinery has she got? How
fast can she go? Can I run her?”</p>

<p>While Mr. Abbott was answering questions, luncheon
was announced, and he passed his hand through his son’s
arm. “We are lunching earlier than usual on your account,
and the time has run away,” he said haltingly.
“I don’t wish to give you too many shocks in one day,
but I must make another confession. You have—I
married again some years ago.”</p>

<p>“My dear father,” replied his son dryly, “if you told
me that you had married Queen Victoria and annexed
the British realm—in fact I expect it. Are there—have
I any more brothers and sisters scattered about
among the palaces of Europe?”</p>

<p>Mr. Abbott laughed. “No, I did not marry another
young wife. Your step-mother is ornamental in her
way; but I selected her partly for companionship—I
had known her always—partly because I wanted some
one to bring up your sister with common-sense and care.
I am perfectly satisfied with her; and, as she is a woman
of infinite tact, I am sure you will get on with her
whether you like her or not. She will probably be a
little late for luncheon—she has so many morning engagements—charities—”</p>

<p>But this was not the occasion for Mrs. Abbott’s tact
to fail her. She had given the father and son their uninterrupted
morning; but to hasten home and preside at
luncheon at the unseemly hour of half-past twelve, to
make such a performance appear both natural and a
compliment, was an occasion for subtlety too rare to be
missed. She was standing in the dining-room as they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
entered, one hand resting on the table, her eyes fixed in
pleasant anticipation on the Gobelin which hung before
the door. She still wore her hat, she was slightly flushed,
her wrap was half removed—her whole appearance
was stamped with delicate haste. As she shook hands
warmly with Fessenden, smiling and talking rapidly in
a very cultivated voice, her step-son wondered at her
extreme unlikeness to any woman of her probable age
that he had ever seen. She was tall, slender, as willowy
as youth; her hair was as black as her eyes, her skin, although
sallow, was without wrinkle or line, and her features
were mobile. She wore a gown of light summer
silk and a large hat, yet both were made and worn with
such tact that the painful affectation of lost youth was
not suggested: she looked what she was, a woman of the
ever-receding middle age, fashionably dressed. Whatever
use she might make of modern science to avert age,
she employed no art to simulate youth, and as her year
was various and crowded, both mind and face were plastic.
Whatever her temperament may have been originally,
she had made it equable long since; and while she
escaped the stigma of amiability, her self-control carried
her evenly through the smooth waters of her life. No
one ever knew whether she were a really intellectual
woman or a brilliantly superficial one, for she had a
delicately masterful habit of changing the conversation,
as if the end of living were to avert the monotonies.
Even in the soft vagueness of chiffon and lace she looked
well groomed, and on the promenade and in her carriage
no one outshone her in distinction. Distinction, indeed,
was the keynote of her personality; and it is doubtful
if she would not have sacrificed all other possible gifts
to this. An efficient housekeeper managed her twenty
servants, her pin-money would have kept an ambitious
family of the middle class in affluence, her life was far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
more luxurious than royalty’s; she was the leader of the
most exclusive old set in New York, presided over the
most important charities, and yet found time to read
the foreign news and play with intellect. With it all
she had the rare good sense to be content with her lot
and to keep her health.</p>

<p>But in spite of this charming personage who diffused
ease as with unseen wings, discontent had assailed Fessenden
again. The immense dim baronial room, the
automatic butler, the catlike footmen, absurdly tall in
their livery, the gold and crystal and floral splendor
of the table, made him long gloomily for <i>Pocahontas</i>
and a “hunk” of Christina’s bread. He was grateful,
however, that Mrs. Abbott talked constantly, in her
sprightly abrupt manner. She had been educated as
thoroughly as an Englishwoman, trained in a deportment
which was a nice mixture of reserve and graciousness—Fessenden
inferred that she would treat a servant
with the utmost consideration, and never permit a liberty
from a friend—and she had cultivated the art of
conversation, of appearing spontaneous—rarely finishing
a long sentence—and of adapting herself to all men,
from a reforming drunkard in the slums straight up to
royalty. She presently divined her step-son’s mental
state, and diverted him by talking of his sister.</p>

<p>“Alexandra spends her winters with the Archduchess,
with whom she was brought up, you know. She hates
New York, but is fond of our home on the Hudson, and
will go with me this summer to Newport—makes her
début, you know—she is just eighteen, but went to court
functions during the year preceding Rudolf’s death.
The Archduchess—they are the same age—came out
at sixteen—the Empress being so much away made a
difference. Alexandra has rather Americanized her, although
in her way she is as much of an individual as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
the German Emperor—if she only becomes American
enough, I believe Europe will hear of her—do you observe
your father smile? It’s too bad, really—if you
rush off yachting like this, you won’t see Alexandra for
months; she has remained later than usual this year,
for the Archduchess is still in terrible distress over the
death of her brother—a greater tragedy for Europe than
for her, however! I wonder how you and Alexandra
will like each other? How odd for you to meet for the
first time at your age! She is most brilliantly educated,
very clever, and a really remarkable linguist; speaks
even Hungarian with fluency, and already has quite
a knowledge of the world—foreign men are such an
education; but I don’t think she will marry early. She
is a handsome girl—looks like your mother, but less
beautiful; not in the least susceptible—has a remarkably
level head; is singularly like your father in many respects.
We hardly fancy she will marry a foreigner. If she does,
her choice is sure to be a wise one; her head is very cool,
and she is in a position to take any step with her eyes
open.”</p>

<p>Fessenden had all the young, or the untravelled,
American’s contempt for the foreigner. As his step-mother
paused for breath, he elevated the nose that
England had given him. “I should hope she wouldn’t,”
he said emphatically. “Aren’t there enough men in
America? Why don’t you make her live over here?
I think hobnobbing with royalty is ridiculous for an
American.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Abbott laughed pleasantly. “If you could only
be an American woman for five minutes! But don’t
worry; your sister is as good an American as you are—we
have seen to that—and, as I have said, remarkably
level-headed; Europe has merely improved, not changed
her. I am positive you will be delighted with her, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
what she can’t tell you of <i>la haute politique</i>!— She is
tremendously interested in you—but I must run! I
have an engagement with the housekeeper, and she has
the vice of promptness. She is moving us to The Abbey,
and we are late this year—I love New York; and as
your father was going abroad, and Alex is so far behind
time—you will excuse me, I know; and mind you come
to tea with me in my own little room at half-past five.
You are included in that invitation, my lord.” And,
nodding brightly, she left the room with an elastic step
that in no way detracted from the light dignity of her
carriage.</p>

<p>Fessenden drew a long breath.</p>

<p>“It is not always so,” said Mr. Abbott, with a smile.
“As I remarked before, she has great tact. She saw
that you were bored, and was determined to entertain
you; but when another wants the floor, I do not know
any one who can yield it more gracefully. But of
course she lives in an atmosphere of flattery—you
must expect to find her rather spoiled; but if you really
are a good American, you won’t mind that. Alexandra
is far less so; she has been educated in a severer school,
and she has a far juster sense of proportion—knows exactly
what the flattery of the courtier amounts to. That
is one reason I have permitted her to be over there so
much—one of many reasons.”</p>

<p>He lapsed into the dreamy condition his son remembered
so well; but he emerged in a few moments, and
waved his hand. The servants disappeared. Mr. Abbott
concentrated his gaze on his son. “Fessenden,”
he said slowly, “I will tell you my programme for the
next year; and please remember, as you listen, that if
you do not like it you are at liberty to follow one of your
own. I shall never do more than suggest again; for I
admit that I have had my day, and that it is your turn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
now. To prove my entire sincerity in this respect, I
shall deposit a million dollars to your credit to-morrow.
That will make you your own master—”</p>

<p>Fessenden had flung himself half-way across the table.
“I know what I will do with it,” he cried eagerly. “I
never dreamed I could get to work so soon—but pardon
me; go ahead, sir. Mine will keep.”</p>

<p>“I have no doubt that plans will come to you very
thickly, but I want you to learn something of Europe
before settling down. I shall take three secretaries on
the yacht with me—I should break down if I relaxed
altogether—and in the course of the journey you will
learn a great deal about my affairs. After that preliminary
course I want you to stay over there for a time,
and apply yourself to the study of Europe. If churches
and picture-galleries happen to interest you, polish them
off as quickly as possible, and then get down beneath
the surface. Study politics, governments, the financial
and commercial conditions of the first-rate powers—make
yourself master at first hand of national traits and
idiosyncrasies; you will have letters that will carry you
everywhere. There are going to be two controlling
forces in the world in the next thirty years, yourself and
William of Germany—if he lives!—if he lives! Keep a
hawk-eye on him, and don’t make the common shallow
mistake of underrating him. He alone can block the
progress of the United States; all the other nations put
together are not worth considering. He only needs certain
conditions to scoop in Europe like another Charlemagne.
It may be that he will create these conditions.
It may be that you will help him to them, if you both
happen to pull in the same direction. That of course
is for the future. I will see that you meet him informally
this summer. But if he fascinates you—as he probably
will—make always this reserve: your future friendship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
for him depends upon his course towards the United
States. It is not too soon to begin checkmating him,
and it can always be done by this country; but it must
be done by the individual. Washington is blind by
too much occupation with other things. Would you
like to walk down-town and see our offices? Historical
landmarks, too—Washington—Hamilton— Let me
hear your plans.”</p>

<p>Fessenden walked slowly towards the rift in the great
wall of rock which marked the land entrance to the fjord.
<i>Pocahontas</i> was dancing just beyond that narrow gate,
but although his fingers tingled for her sail, his step still
halted; he knew that she would bring him swiftly within
range of the keen thumping of a typewriter, possibly of
more than one. He was dutifully and even deeply interested
in his father’s vast affairs, and there were nights
when he went to bed with the sensation that the Earth
was his pillow; there were days when he dared to hope
the time would come when he could with pleasure embroider
the scenery with figures and puncture the silences
of Nature with a typewriter. But the time was
not yet. Four days since he had awakened his father at
three in the morning, informed him that he was off for a
solitary tramp into Norway, and promised to return at
the end of a week. Conscience was driving him home
sooner than he had intended, for he had revelled in the
stillness and solitude of his wild and lonely tramp.
He missed at first the friendliness of the Adirondacks,
the only other mountains he knew; but the harsh and
terrible grandeur about him companioned his mood—finally
inspired him with a passionate sense of gratitude.
For he was in a desperate state of rebellion. The philosophy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
he had invoked on the heels of Mr. Abbott’s
revelation had but deferred the inevitable moment. He
did not doubt that the future presented to him by his
father would bring him power, but that future was—he
sincerely hoped—far distant, and at present he was little
more than a glorified clerk in training. His inheritance
and his education permitted him to grasp the stupendous
details with a sufficient facility, and there were moments
when he was staggered and overwhelmed with the
thought of such world-manipulating power, at others
intoxicated with dreams of a future when himself should
be a ruler of many times the strength of any monarch in
Europe. In such moments he felt arrogant, and contemptuous
of sovereigns who were but the tools of a people
or a cabinet, no matter what the euphemisms, longed
for the time to come when he could demonstrate to
them the absolutism of concentrated capital in the hands
of an uncrowned ruler of a great republic. But reaction
under the lonely stars invariably chastened him. What
did he amount to now? Who would recognize in him
more than his famous father’s second? He was bursting
with energy, with ambition for himself and the
United States, and, in spite of his father’s love and sincere
indulgence, he felt like a prisoner on parole. It is
true that when he had confided his cherished ideal, the
great and beneficent conception which was to have
worked his fingers to the bone and made him old in his
youth, Mr. Abbott had waved his golden wand. A
Western desert hummed and echoed, and even now a
huge building was rising on its foundations, and the first
of the world’s electricians, for a yearly salary which
made Fessenden’s head swim, had agreed to occupy this
building with a corps of assistants and work upon the
idea which a youth had conceived. The author of the
idea felt no temptation to take charge himself. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
mere fact that more experienced genius could be bought
delivered him from the thrall of his ideal, although he
still took a scientific and patriotic interest in its accomplishment.</p>

<p>Robbed of this dream of immortality, he had dropped
the curtain upon his inner life and endeavored to fulfil his
immediate destiny. As his powers of concentration
were very great, he had succeeded for a time. During
the fortnight before sailing, novelty and wonder had
sustained him, and for a time at sea the long conversations
with his father were agreeably varied by instructions
in the science of yachting. But Fessenden was
Fessenden—a personality, a young man bursting with
precocious energy, ambition, independence. His reassertion
was slow but persistent, and during one sleepless
night alone on deck the naked truth confronted him that
he was at the end of his endurance, that however he
might conform to his father’s wishes in the future, for
the present he must not only have an interval of personal
liberty, but arrange his nebulous ambitions and
satisfy them. He restrained his impatience until three
o’clock, then awakened Mr. Abbott—who smiled and
slept again—and plunged without a guide into Norway.</p>

<p>He bathed in streams, he slept under the stars, he saw
no one but peasants, he hardly uttered a word for three
days; and he was completely happy. When he was not
in mountain gorges he was in pine forests; everywhere
he had Nature in her magnificence, and he was alone.
For two days he refused to think—it was enough to forget,
to feel the freedom of the years when he believed
himself innocent of fortune, with a glorious and self-made
future stretching through infinite horizons. But
on the evening of the third day he turned his back on
the scenery, sat down on the grass, and thought.</p>

<p>That the prospect before him was hateful and hideous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
he admitted aloud, lest he should seem to blink any
modicum of the truth. The abstract fact that he was
a rich man instead of a poor one dwindled to comparative
insignificance beside the million details which made
up the sum of that fact. Had he been the author of
those details, his inherited and financial instincts, so
quick at college, would no doubt possess him and obliterate
the dreams of his youth. But that mountain of particulars,
massive and petty, had fallen upon him without
a moment’s warning, and he was not its illustrious
author, but its future custodian. The youth in him was
rampant, and his strong vein of romance unsatisfied.
He admitted—again aloud—that he was as romantic as
he was practical. He would train to succeed his father,
but meanwhile would distinguish himself in his own
manner. He would use the wealth at his disposal, but
the manner should be picturesque.</p>

<p>Without admitting that he intended to demand a
period of liberty, his imagination in the past weeks had
toyed with many plans. At first, when he learned of
the more than thousands in his father’s employ, he had
been fired with the desire to ameliorate the lot of the
working-man; and in his enthusiasm had awakened his
father from his afternoon nap on deck and talked to him
for an hour. Mr. Abbott, who revelled in the very sound
of Fessenden’s voice, and would have attempted to give
him the North Pole had he wanted it, listened indulgently;
but when his turn came to speak he was smiling
grimly.</p>

<p>“My dear boy,” he had said, “what reason have I
given you to think me a fool? There are those who will
tell you that the day must come when the streets of our
great cities will run red with blood, when not one stone
on Fifth Avenue will remain upon another; that, in
short, the great civil war between capital and labor can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
be delayed only until a strong leader of organized labor
arises who cannot be bought. I do not go so far as to
say that I—or you—can avert that calamity, for our
rotten municipal governments have destroyed the respect
of the thinking laboring man for authority, and
these tremendous aggregations of capital I have in hand,
which will make the United States strong and feared
among nations, may be carried to an excess which will
lessen the chances of individual achievement and curtail
personal liberty. If rich men—that is to say, the manipulators—make
fools of themselves, and in their greed for
wealth and power reduce wages and sow further seeds of
discontent, there is no telling what may happen. But
although I make no denial of my own greed for wealth
and power, and although these concentrations of many
small industries into one huge enterprise will double my
fortune, I make no such mistake as that. I have always
maintained that a man may get rich and still share a
certain portion of his gains with his assistants; and my
working-men all receive good salaries, perquisites, heavy
Christmas presents, and pensions in their old age. I
make no pretence at philanthropy. There is no man
who needs friends as the rich man does; there are no
friends so valuable as an army of employés. I know
many of mine personally; at some time or other I have
managed to come into contact with most of them. They
like me. They are content. They never go on strike.
They are the one formidable bulwark against united
labor in the country. When you return, I wish you
to go about among those men, show them your personal
interest in them as human beings, make them love you as
much as they like me; then, if an industrial war ever
comes, you will make yourself their leader and take
whichever side you think wisest. But the thing to do is
to avert war and use that great following for another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
purpose. Either with or without civil war the time must
come for the reform of municipalities, the reduction of
state power, and, possibly, an interval of benevolent
despotism. There is the rôle I have cut out for you;
but meanwhile work with me to avert the worst calamity
which could visit this country—set it back a hundred
years. My men are not overpaid; they receive strict
justice, that is all. I have harangued for hours with
almost every great employer in the country, appealing
to his common-sense, even his cupidity, but in most
cases in vain. The average rich man in the United
States is lowly born. He has worked himself up from
the ranks. There never was a real democrat who was
not born an aristocrat. The risen plebeian is a tyrant,
is insatiable in his greed, glories in the thought of grinding
the life out of thousands of his own class, delights in
the hatred and envy which are but another signal of his
success; in short, he is a damned fool, and deserves to
wake up and find his throat cut. I suppose all revolutions
are the result of stupidity. Ours, if it comes, will
arise from no other cause whatever. If you have the
genius in you that I believe, you will avert this war or
control it. Now I will sleep again if you will permit
me.”</p>

<p>The words had kept Fessenden awake all night, but
after several days his enthusiasm cooled. Again he
was willing to take the helm whenever the time came,
and with all his energies; but the idea was his father’s,
not his. His young ego, uniquely developed, demanded
creation.</p>

<p>During the last day of his tramp he had looked down
twenty avenues of possible greatness, and turned his
back upon all. He was not discouraged, for he knew
that inspiration comes suddenly, even if it be the final
result of industrious raking. He was now returning to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
demand a vacation of some months, during which he
would tramp and study Europe in his own way. But
inspiration was closer than he knew, and although he
was to tramp Europe again and again with various and,
in one case, extraordinary results, there were to be intervening
years.</p>

<p>As he jumped into his canoe and set his sail, he saw
that the <i>Alexandra</i> was no longer the solitary inhabitant
of the fjord. Not half a mile from his father’s yacht
was what looked to be a miniature man-of-war. It was
painted white, and had a heavily gilded figure-head. In
a few moments he was close enough to see the colors and
design on the standard. He whistled and experienced
a glow of anticipation.</p>

<p>“The German Emperor! I hardly know whether I
am more anxious to see him or his yacht. Ours is the
biggest in the world—of course!—his is the most original;
but that may only mean resource: he couldn’t get the
money voted any other way. The more I hear of Europe
the rottener it appears, with the exception of Germany.
This man seems to be making an American city
out of Berlin, and to have plenty of sand all-round.
Some one has said of him that he is an autocrat with a
Yankee head on his shoulders; and, if that is the case, he
may be worth studying for future points.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when a half-hour later his father told
him that the Emperor had invited him to visit the
<i>Hohenzollern</i> the day of his return, he sniffed with youthful
Americanism.</p>

<p>“I don’t fancy waiting till I’m spoken to,” he announced—“for
his high-mightiness to introduce every
subject. He may be interesting in himself, but he is a
monarch, and I have no use for any of them. They are
a burlesque in the end of the nineteenth century.”</p>

<p>“Tell that to William, if you like, and introduce what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
subjects interest you—if you get a chance. He observes
little formality up here, and less with Americans.
Now please go and exchange that sweater and those
pants—they are not trousers—for a suit of flannels.”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">XXI</h3>
</div>

<p>Fessenden drew a long and audible breath. It had not
occurred to him soon enough to keep tally, but he felt
justified in assuming that he had answered eight hundred
questions. The power and magnetism of the Emperor
still impressed him, but the fascination had waned.
When he had boarded the yacht early in the afternoon,
excited with a sensation that was half eager curiosity,
half aggressive fear of being patronized, and had received
a hearty greeting from a man as informal as he
was charming, Fessenden had promptly conceived his
first enthusiasm for a contemporary. He had as promptly
reminded himself that he too intended to inspire
enthusiasms—that his was not the rôle of the follower;
nevertheless he had beamed back upon his imperial host;
and, in spite of a flinty reserve in the background of both
pairs of eyes, a mutual friendship was conceived at once.
The Emperor had taken care to cement his personal
fascination by exhibiting the machinery of his new
yacht to his curious young guest, and a twenty-minutes’
argument on a subject of which one had much practical
knowledge and the other almost as much by theory and
observation, established a respect as strong as the sentiment.
But when they were seated alone on deck, the
Emperor’s inquiring mind was no longer to be restrained.
A conversation with Mr. Abbott the day before had excited
his curiosity; his interrogations began upon Fessenden’s
babyhood; and then, with the rapid strokes of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
a minute impressionist, never losing sight of causes and
effects, he built up a complete picture of a self-made
boy with a beneficent providence in the background. In
three-quarters of an hour he not only knew the boy in
the wilderness as well as the boy had known himself,
but the history of the Nettlebecks, the size and condition
of their farm, their attitude—or, as he discovered, their
lack of attitude—towards Germany, the area of the
Adirondack tract, the attention—or lack of attention—given
it by the government, the inferior condition, as
compared with Germany, of its forests, its roads, its
bridges. His questions and comments showed such
grasp and activity of intelligence that for a time Fessenden
was as interested as the Man of Questions, and there
were intervals when he was permitted to give a bit of
thrilling description, notably of logging-camps and
“driving,” which, as the Emperor’s eyes kindled and
his horned upper lip twitched, flattered him for five or
six consecutive minutes.</p>

<p>But from the Adirondacks, William passed swiftly to
the Western University, and here his curiosity threatened
to be insatiable. His questions indicated that Harvard
and Yale could tell him no secrets, but of this more
modern institution he had never heard until the day
before; and an enterprise so novel, practical, and cheap
appealed irresistibly to a ruler bent upon modernizing
his country and making it the strongest industrially in
Europe. He made no secret of the cause of his interest,
and Fessenden sympathized heartily with the ambitious
and energetic young monarch, and glowed at the thought
of flinging a handful of American seeds broadcast upon
the German Empire. But at the end of an hour and a
quarter, when he had not only presented a picture of
the university in all its complex details, from its methods
of military drill to the last drop of grease in the machine-shops,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
but had sketched the personalities of all the professors
and the most notable of the students, the strident
tones of the august interlocutor seemed to be banging
about in his brain, the abrupt rapid firing to have
torn his nerves to tatters. The impatient action of his
lungs receiving no attention from his host, whose eyes
were concentrated and glittering, he sprang suddenly to
his feet.</p>

<p>“Look here!” he exclaimed. “I really can’t stand
it any longer. I’ll come back to-morrow, if you like. I
think you are a great man, and I’m only too delighted
to help you in any way I can, but if you ask me another
question to-day I’ll jump off the yacht.”</p>

<p>For a second the Emperor’s eyes had flashed with a
haughty surprise which gave Fessenden a passing glimpse
of outraged majesty, but he recovered himself swiftly,
and before the plaint finished he had sprung to his feet
and grasped Fessenden’s hand, looking like a contrite
school-boy.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” he stammered. “How inhospitable!—I
never was so tactless in my life. But you have
interested me so deeply. You are the most extraordinary
young man—will you forgive me? and will you do
me the honor to return for dinner? Mr. Abbott comes
too.”</p>

<p>A warm responsiveness rushed through Fessenden’s
veins and flashed from his frank impatient eyes; and he
returned the hearty grasp of the other’s hand. But although
the two men were mutually and strongly attracted,
almost to the point of effusiveness, they nevertheless,
and almost unconsciously, stared hard and long at each
other. For the moment, despite aggressive differences,
they looked alike. Their personalities pushed aside the
mask of their features and snatched the knowledge that
for them it was love or hate, friendship or enmity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
mutual assistance or a bitter lifelong struggle, which
might waste their energies and thwart their most passionate
hopes.</p>

<p>William was the older and subtler. He laid his hand
affectionately on his new friend’s shoulder. “I have
suspected something of your father’s ultimate plans for
you,” he said. “Now I am sure. I can help you as
much as you can help me. The next time we are alone,
turn the tables and ask me as many questions as you
like. There is no reason why you should ever remind
yourself that I am an Emperor—why our friendship
should not be as informal and sincere as that of your
charming sister and the daughter of the Emperor of
Austria.”</p>

<p>“Do you know my sister?”</p>

<p>“Of course, and since she was twelve years old. But
her chosen friend is my sworn enemy.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>That night, in the retirement of his state-room, Fessenden
brushed his hair backward and his mustache upright.
The Emperor at dinner had drawn his coils more
closely. He had been brilliant, demonstrative, instructive,
humorous, almost unegotistical. He had made
Fessenden shine without asking a question, and he had
toasted Mr. Abbott in the effusive rhetoric with which
one ripened sovereign disguises his fear of another.
Fessenden forgot his long array of self-made heroes—even
those who had been cradled in purple and yet ridden
victoriously through the pages of history. He took
up an autographed picture of William, presented at parting,
and studied it attentively, then regarded his own
smooth young face with dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>“However,” he thought, “in his earlier photographs
he had even less character than I have. It’s since he
got his own way that he’s put it on with a brush. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
suppose I can have that eagle roll of the eye in time,
too, if I choose, and square my iron jaw, and look as if
I were hewn out of finely tempered steel. He has a
sensitive mouth, all the same.”</p>

<p>In a moment he parted his short hair rapidly and
brushed his mustache into a dejected curve. “I’d like
to see myself!” he thought, with some irritation. “He
<i>would</i> have the laugh on me to-morrow!”</p>

<p>He sat for an hour and pondered deeply on all that had
passed between himself and the Emperor of Germany
that day. Then he started up suddenly, opened the door
of the adjoining state-room, and awakened his father.</p>

<p>“What does William want?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Europe and South America,” murmured Mr. Abbott
sleepily.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">XXII</h3>
</div>

<p>The tremendous walls of the fjord were black, but the
moon poured in a flood of light. There had been a sharp
breeze earlier in the evening, and Fessenden had invited
the Emperor out in <i>Pocahontas</i>; then, perceiving the
difficulty of keeping him quiet, had given him the sheet.
The Emperor had accepted the invitation with alacrity—he
was not only happy and at home in a canoe, but
although he had now had several long conversations with
the young American, something in this new personality
evaded him, and he was determined to find it. Fessenden,
on the other hand, was studying him attentively,
his interest in the most remarkable specimen of living
royalty quite distinct from his liking for the man.
William had not refrained from questions during this past
week, and Fessenden had been permitted to learn Germany
from the Throne. When he had mentioned that
he intended, a year or two hence, to tramp the Empire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
and study it from another point of view, the Kaiser had
promptly extracted a promise to bring the burden of his
information to Berlin.</p>

<p>William expressed a lively sympathy for his young
friend’s desire for immediate distinction, and confided
some of the difficulties of majesty in getting its own
way. Nevertheless he felt that Fessenden, despite his
romantic enthusiasm for himself, was frank only to a
certain point. He thought of all in his own depths that
he could give to no man, and forbore to press him too
closely; but his abnormally acute brain suspected something
in that deliberate reserve which concerned himself,
and he had accepted the proposal of the lonely sail
in the hope of an impulsive confidence. He had no
suspicion that the younger man had brought him out
for the purpose of making this confidence.</p>

<p>The wind fell, and they left the canoe to stretch their
legs.</p>

<p>“Do you really believe in the divine right of kings?”
asked Fessenden abruptly. “I mean <i>you</i>.”</p>

<p>The Emperor stared, then laughed outright. “Certainly!”
he announced in that harsh abrupt voice which
conveyed the impression that he had not the patience to
lie. Then, having his own reasons for expanding under
the influence of the lonely moon, he added: “Is not a
peasant a peasant by divine law? How much more a
hereditary ruler with his terrible responsibilities! With
our vast fund of inherited knowledge and traditions,
our instinct for rule, our gift of commanding respect
and obedience, we are far more successful as rulers than
your presidents, chosen every four or eight years from
all sorts and conditions of life, and more often for some
unworthy political reason than for any merit in the
man.” He added deliberately: “The monarchs of the
earth are the chosen deputies of God in Heaven; they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
rule their people by right divine. The time will come
when you will feel this as deeply as I do now. Of course
my understanding is illumined with the torch of the
centuries; but there must be a beginning,” he added
graciously.</p>

<p>“And you disassociate yourself absolutely from the
race?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. So will you one day.”</p>

<p>“I am a good democrat, and I believe in the principles
of the American Constitution and the Declaration
of Independence.”</p>

<p>“Quite so—as long as they are permitted to hold; but
when your revolution comes they will go down with the
rest, and then you will no longer be a democrat.” The
pronounced roll of William’s r-r-r-r’s made him utter
the last word as if he hated it.</p>

<p>“And I suppose you think the Monroe Doctrine would
go too?”</p>

<p>“It would be as well to begin a new government on a
sensible international basis,” said the Emperor dryly.
“That doctrine only maintains its fictitious life by the
courtesy, or perhaps I should say the indifference—the
present indifference—of Europe. It means nothing
until you have established it by force of arms. It would
be better to abandon it gracefully while there is yet
time.”</p>

<p>The two men were picking their way through an uneven
pass. Fessenden halted and leaned against the
wall of rock. He fixed his eyes, which in the brilliant
night light shone like steel, on the imperious and searching
orbs that swung round him abruptly.</p>

<p>“It is by converting the Monroe Doctrine from a
theory into a principle of international law without a
war with Europe that I propose to make my fame,” he
said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>William’s pale face twitched, then settled into its
hardest lines. He returned Fessenden’s stare, and there
was neither friendship nor good-fellowship in his eyes;
he was a monarch on the alert in the presence of the
enemy. It was a moment before he spoke; then he said
coldly:</p>

<p>“It is a large and, no doubt, patriotic idea. I shall be
interested to watch the method develop. When shall
you get to work? When shall Europe have its first
astonished glimpse of your purpose?”</p>

<p>“Europe will know nothing until it is too late to
interfere; but I shall tell you the whole scheme
now.”</p>

<p>“Tell me!” cried the German Emperor in his astonishment.</p>

<p>“I owe the idea to you, and, crazy as it may appear, I
shall confide it to you. I should be rather base if I did
not; and I rely, if not on your generosity, then on your
foresight, to let me alone. You can have Europe, and
welcome, and when the time comes that you need my
help you will get it; but you can’t have South America—not
an inch of it; and now I’ll tell you why—”</p>

<p>“Suppose I decline to listen?”—and none but himself
could know what it cost him to admit that possibility.
But the excitable color had flashed into his face, and his
eyes were glittering. “If I do listen,” he added in a
moment, “I decline to commit myself beforehand.”</p>

<p>“It won’t matter. Even if you betrayed me you
could not obstruct my purpose. Of course I wish my
secret kept. Only the fool takes the world into his confidence.
I only tell you—well, not so much for the reason
I just gave, as because you have given me your
friendship, and I like you better than any one on earth
except my father. You would have suggested the idea
in any case; and if we had been cut out for enemies I’d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
have left the next day, and it would have been a year
before you would have known what I was up to.”</p>

<p>The Emperor’s face did not soften. He felt anything
but sentimental. “Why are you so sure that Europe—that
I—could not balk you?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Because I have a hundred million dollars at my disposal
at the present moment, and the work will be done
before you can cook up a war with the United States.”</p>

<p>The Emperor turned gray, and let his temper fly.
“Damn your American billions!” he cried. “If I could
lay my hands on that amount—”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Fessenden. “When the time comes
you can have it.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">“I &#160;WISH I had been born in Oshkosh or Massachusetts,”
said the Archduchess, with innocent humor.</p>

<p>“What have you been doing with yourself?” asked
Alexandra. “Your letters were long enough, but they
seemed to say less than usual.”</p>

<p>The Archduchess Ranata Theresia took her friend by
the arm and led her to the window. The fine lace
which covered it, woven with the double eagle of the
House of Hapsburg, concealed every detail of the room
from the curious below, but was a mere veil to those
behind it.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know this prospect!” exclaimed the American
girl.</p>

<p>The private apartments of the Hofburg look down
upon the Franzensplatz, an oblong court-yard of inconsiderable
size, surrounded by flat and dingy walls, its
bare surface relieved only by a bronze Hapsburg leaning
upon all the virtues he knew not in life. Opposite is
the guard-room. In the court-yard to-day were a few
tourists staring at the bronze or the remains of the moat
and the gilded armorial bearings on the eastern side.
All sorts and conditions of people, from peasants with
their market-baskets to the hurrying bourgeois and the
member of Parliament, took the short cut through the
Palace court-yards, while private carriages, with servants
in mediæval liveries, and rickety cabs, driven by reckless
shouting <i>kutschers</i>, awoke the hollow echoes of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
deep portals, and clattered across the platz. From two
of the upper windows housemaids were shaking rugs,
and the only ornaments of the dreary scene were the
tall well-built house-guards, who, lackeys as they were,
carried their all-round horse-hair plumes and glittering
uniforms with the elegance and distinction so indiscriminately
lavished by Nature upon the Austrian race.</p>

<p>“I know this scene!” repeated Alexandra. “And I
usually turn my back upon it. Why—why—doesn’t
the Emperor have the private apartments on the Heldenplatz,
where at least you might see trees and the
tops of the buildings on the Ringstrasse? This would
drive some people melancholy mad. You have not
been standing at this window ever since I left you, I
hope? Trotting solemnly round the riding-school is
better than that. But you seem to have been in Vienna
more than usual this year. I congratulated myself that
this was the year I was detained in New York.”</p>

<p>“That is brutal! I have only left this prison for two
months at Ischl. Between the fire at Schönbrunn and
various political reasons, we have been here since you
left—now eight months ago! And as you are my only
real companion—! I do sometimes wish I had been born
an American.”</p>

<p>“There is an asylum in America whenever you make
up your mind to run. I have a handsome determined
and adventurous brother—he has heard of you! You
have only to say the word and his yacht will be in the
Adriatic.”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk romantic nonsense. I’m not up to it.”</p>

<p>The Archduchess turned her back on the window and
sat down before a table in an upright chair. Alexandra
took a rocking-chair—one of three she had long since
presented to the Hofburg, that she might always be
sure of a comfortable seat. Ranata had no idea whatever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
of comfort. Her morning bath was supplied by a
procession of servants bringing the necessary amount
of water in ewers—she had never seen water gush from
pipes except into a fountain, and she privately believed
that rocking-chairs were a relic of the North American
Indian. But if her apartments were as high and angular
and unhomelike as those of most royal palaces, she had
a decided love of splendor, and originality enough to
avoid crimson and white-and-gold. The morbid virginal
face of young Ludvig von Bayern looked down
from the wall opposite the windows of her salon, and
although she made sport of his vanity, she gave the
portrait a place for the sake of its beauty, and approved
of one form his madness had taken. The walls and
windows of her salon were panelled with blue velvet
lightly embroidered with gold. The tables, most of the
ornaments, several chairs, and even the window-seats
were made from blocks of <i>lapis lazuli</i>. On one side of
the lofty room were her books—English, German,
French, and Hungarian—bound in flexible blue-and-white
morocco, an unconscious tribute perhaps to her
humbler Bavarian blood. Scattered among the embroideries
on the walls were many miniatures. In the
small writing-room adjoining was a large desk of gilt
and <i>lapis lazuli</i>, with furnishings of gold and blue vellum.
In this little room was one picture only, a small painting
of Rudolf in the costume of the Transylvanian sportsman.
The frame of this picture was eternally hidden
under a wreath of green or flowers.</p>

<p>The walls of her bedroom and breakfast-room were
panelled with the Gobelins of which the Hapsburgs have
the monopoly in abundance and splendor. Her ancient
narrow bed, surmounted by the insignia of her house
clutching at a mass of yellow brocade and lace, was high
on a dais. Alexandra declared that it looked like a catafalque,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
and was haunted with the <i>ennuis</i> and miseries of
a hundred princesses long since forgotten. When Ranata,
sleepless and in want of sympathy, demanded
companionship, she was forced to transfer her imperial
person into the enamelled and inlaid but wide and
modern bed of her American friend, who did what she
could to banish ghosts. Alexandra had diplomatically
refurnished her apartments by degrees, until now they
were those of a young American who, while extravagant
and luxurious, was studious of music and books
and a devotee of light and air. Ranata never felt at
home in them, but they exercised over her a certain
fascination, for they breathed the freedom of their
owner’s personality.</p>

<p>“I am told,” continued the Archduchess, still with an
inflection of bitterness, “that there are people who envy
royalty!”</p>

<p>“That is your safeguard—the glamour. It is that
blinding halo more than any other cause that has made
this country rise serenely after six crushing defeats in
one century. The Lord’s anointed—genial yet remote—afflicted
beyond all men, yet carefully preserved to his
state and people—alive yet dead—kind and just yet—”</p>

<p>She paused abruptly, for although Ranata was at
times extravagantly informal and confidential with the
one friend to whom her rank meant nothing, Alexandra,
with all her audacity, never ventured beyond a certain
point. There were moments when Ranata’s ancestors
rose in her soul and peremptorily ordered up the drawbridge
which the lonely princess loved to fling recklessly
at the feet of her American friend; to taste the sweets of
girlish intercourse, unrestrained by the fear of imperilling
her royal dignity or untainted by the suspicion of
self-interest. There was no honor that the House of
Hapsburg could bestow upon the American, and Ranata<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
knew that court life was too old a story to offer any further
attractions to Alexandra. If the Archduchess had
not been fully aware that the Austrian Court was the
dullest in Europe, Alexandra would have enlightened
her: her lively friend could rehearse every word that
would be uttered at a function, the tidbits of scandal
that would be murmured at royal dinners after the terrible
interval of no conversation whatever. But for Ranata
she cherished a deep and almost romantic affection,
and believed her existence to be the most tragic in the
world. Had it been possible—and it was a possibility
of which she never despaired—she would have carried
her off to New York; but for the present she spent six
months of every year in Austria, and sowed seeds of
which the Emperor and his court knew nothing; for
outside the privacy of these rooms she was more European
than American. Although she was now accepted
as a matter of course, for several years the haughtiest
and most exclusive people on earth had tolerated her
with ill-concealed resentment, by no means unexaggerated
by jealousy; and Alexandra, feeling that the pride
of her country was involved, to say nothing of her own
comfort, had succeeded in obliterating all trace of the
alien. Only an American can imagine the force of the
reaction. And this morning, returning after a long absence
to find her friend more than ever in need of the
diversion she knew so well how to provide, she was forced
to pause suddenly and bite her lip. But Ranata’s ancestors
were slumbering, and the atmosphere of freedom
came subtly to her nostrils.</p>

<p>“If possible, my father is more of a machine than
ever,” she remarked dryly. “I sometimes think that
his very remarks to me at dinner—I see less and less of
him anywhere else—are dictated by his ministers. I
don’t blame him, poor man, for being afraid to love anybody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
again. If he wants to be a machine, I should be
the last to deny him, and I really believe that he now
feels nothing, and is a mere automaton from four in the
morning until he goes to sleep peacefully at nine in the
evening. I wish I were a machine myself. It must be
the only refuge this side the grave. But the stupid
physical fact is that my nerve-cells are still stronger
than my fibrous tissue, and I must wait thirty years or
so for Nature to do her work.”</p>

<p>“Your afflictions have been shocking, poor dear—”</p>

<p>“I am not thinking of my afflictions. No one experienced
in sorrow will ever whine. It is the future I am
thinking of—to say nothing of the present. I am
twenty-eight. Except when you are here I am utterly
without companionship, unless, to be sure, when I am
in the country on a horse. Here in Vienna, as you
know, I rarely leave the Hofburg—leave these rooms
only for the riding-school or some other part of the
palace; for my father—or his ministers—seems to dislike
more and more the attention I attract whenever I
show myself abroad—”</p>

<p>She paused abruptly and gave a curious sidelong
glance at her friend.</p>

<p>“You have been thinking of matrimony!” exclaimed
Alexandra.</p>

<p>“Yes—twice during the past year. I have been almost
tempted to consider it—almost, but not quite.
The change would be too temporary. If there is one
thing that must surpass the eternal boredom of unmarried
royal women, it is putting up with a wired automaton
and bearing his sickly children. And liberty!
Now, at least, I can lock these doors, and even my father
would not force them, and my ladies are only too
glad to be relieved of my society. But perhaps I have
spoken too strongly. In solitude I have found much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
happiness. I can dream and dream, and forget that not
the least of my dreams can ever come true.”</p>

<p>She had spoken flippantly, quite brutally, but she
finished with an accent of profound sadness.</p>

<p>“You will become morbid if you are not careful,”
said Miss Abbott seriously. “Only the deliberately
cultivated reasonableness with which you have accepted
this deadly—and ridiculous—life of yours, and the superhuman
control you have acquired over your natural
impatience and impulsiveness, have saved you so far.
But thirty is a dangerous age. I am beginning to feel
it myself—wasted emotions, opportunities, passing
youth—all that sort of thing. You, my dear, grow
more beautiful every day, and your beauty has done
you so little good! Gasps and murmurs as you trail
down between the tapestries of the Great Hall of Ceremonies
in the most gorgeous white gowns ever seen,
or ride once a year or so in the Prater!” She paused
a moment, and then added deliberately: “Why not cut
it? It is incongruous and monstrous to see the most
intelligent women in Europe cramped in a three-by-six
cage like one of Louis XI.’s victims. What keeps you?
Nothing but the silliest superstition in the world to-day,
drivelling out its precarious existence. You have your
own money. My father can double and treble it. My
step-mother would preserve you from all scandal. You
could exercise your gifts and have a career, or marry
and be happy. Come along—don’t be an idiot.”</p>

<p>“There is just one thing you never can understand.
I know you think we are fatuous, if not mad, to believe
ourselves heaven-born, divinely appointed; but here we
are, we have our inherited duties, and here we must remain.
Ourselves are the last we are permitted to consider
from our coming to our going. We come into this
world with a birthright of obligations to millions of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
people whose ancestors permitted us first to mount the
throne—in our case eight centuries ago! We Hapsburgs
have been threatened with annihilation, we have
lost much that was precious, the German Empire overshadows
and threatens us, and God knows what will
happen when my father dies. But although our star
has often turned black, it has never gone out. It has a
way of flashing up from its embers and disconcerting
Europe that suggests eternal fires—if they are carefully
watched. And it is the hearth fires that need watching.
William’s ambitions will come to nothing if our people
stand firm. I have no illusion regarding the real danger.
So long as my father lives we are safe against the
worst that revolutionists can do. But Rudolf is dead!
Both Austria and Hungary detest the Heir, that cold
bigot, who has never a smile for the people. And court
life will cease when he comes to the throne, for it is not
likely he will divorce that woman and marry a princess.
Only the most watchful care can save us. The Hungarians
are straining at the bit all the time, and the
moment disintegration begins William will find some
pretext to march in. He will lose no more time than
Frederick lost when he saw a woman ascend a tottering
throne. Although I am permitted to take no part in
politics, I still have a rôle to play which is of almost as
much importance to my country as my father’s. One
of my obligations is to make the world believe that a
princess is above ordinary temptations and weaknesses—a
tradition which the Hapsburgs have done more
than any royal house to obliterate—and that makes my
personal duty the more obvious. Another thing, as
you know—to the world I am not even the individual.
During these last ten years my study has been to persuade
my father’s people that I am the conventional,
safely stupid, and normal princess, to make them forget<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
my mother’s supposed gift to this House. If I should
do what you propose, Austria would either assume that
I was as mad as Ludvig and Otto, or, were they convinced
that I had a better brain than my sort, they
would accept my act as a deliberate insult to the monarchical
idea. In either case I should loosen one more
stone in these rotting foundations of ours. Marriage
out of class, elopement, a whispered intrigue—they are
accustomed to all! But a deliberate renunciation,
based on non-sentimental grounds, a flight to America—that
would be the new thing with a vengeance, and it
is only the innovation that tells. Oh, if Rudolf had
lived. If Rudolf—Rudolf—”</p>

<p>She pushed back her chair violently, banished the
seriousness from her face.</p>

<p>“Enough of this infliction. I have opened the safety-valves
and feel better. Come, show me your new
frocks. Are they finer than mine? What have you
brought me from New York? And the bonbons! the
bonbons! Do you know where we go two weeks from
to-day? To Hungary, for the autumn manœuvres. I
am so glad! I have not been to Budapest since I was
a child. I long to go. I love Hungary. It dares to rebel,
and sometimes it gets what it wants. And our dear
cousin Willy is to be our guest. He’s bound to come
with a sensation up his sleeve. Sometimes I regret
that I was not old enough to marry him, for although I
fear and sometimes hate him, life with him might have
been interesting, for he at least is a man.”</p>

<p>When Alexandra was twelve years old Mrs. Abbott
had taken her to Vienna to consult a famous surgeon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
for a threatened deformity. He had commanded that
the child be left under his care for at least five years,
and Mrs. Abbott, whose devotion to her husband
amounted to a mannerism, left her with an old friend, a
Hungarian, whose infinite quarterings made her one of
that small band so closely allied with the court that
they have never learned to snub, since nobody has
ever dared to take a liberty with them. This lady,
who had married one of the Princes Windischgrätz
had formed a friendship with Mrs. Abbott in her impulsive
youth when the American’s father had been
minister to Austria, renewing it when she returned as
the wife of a secretary of Legation. The young husband
had died in Vienna, and the Princess had shown
a sincere and spontaneous sympathy which cemented
their friendship into an intimacy where each might dare
to accept a favor from the other. She also extravagantly
admired the American’s toilettes, having a natural
and exquisite taste, and rebelling at the frequent necessity
to wear an old gown, soiled and frayed, perhaps,
under her load of family jewels. After her friend married
the chieftain of millions, she visited her in New
York and Newport, and was deeply impressed with a
style of living far more comfortable and luxurious than
anything in Europe, and quite as magnificent. Immobile
to a world whose existence she barely admitted,
with her own class she was simple and natural; and Mrs.
Abbott having acquired the same tactics in an early experience
of European courts, there was no marked external
difference between these two exalted dames, and
much in common. The friendship never waned, for Mrs.
Abbott was frequently in Europe, and was the first
American to dress in Vienna; when, therefore, she was
for once in a way confronted with a serious problem, the
Princess came gallantly to the rescue, and Alexandra<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
for three years lived in a palace immense and chilly,
but as full of old furniture and pictures as a museum,
and often of gay Hungarian relatives who played high
and slept late.</p>

<p>The “Princess Sarolta,” as she was known to the elect,
was a woman of much heart and cynicism, of strong
loves and stronger hates. Without children of her own,
one of the deepest affections of her life had been for the
Archduke Rudolf. Her pet aversion had been the Empress,
whom she denounced as a mixture of the country
girl and the mystic, wholly unfit to wear a crown. She
never forgave her for being, not von Bayern, but in
Bayern; and when, in addition to the comparative insignificance
of her birth, the sweet and gentle but shy
and unhappy Empress treated a throne with contumely
and sought the consolations of the inner life, the Princess
became her most contemptuous enemy.</p>

<p>To Ranata the Princess transferred the affection she
had given to Rudolf, although it was unmixed with the
enthusiasm inspired by the brilliant if reckless hope of a
house to which she was loyally devoted. When Alexandra
was left on her hands Rudolf was still alive, but
she was much interested in the rebellious little Archduchess,
who in looks and temperament was unlike her
mother or any of the recent Hapsburg women; and
partly out of sympathy, partly because it pleased her
to do one original thing in her life, she brought the two
children together on all their holidays.</p>

<p>They promptly gave to each other their hoarded stores
of affection. Alexandra, lively, fearless, without awe of
rank, yet with too much inherited and inculcated taste to
take the wrong sort of liberty with the humblest of her
friends, seemed in the nature of a divine gift to a princess
who was never permitted to forget her rank by the
children of the court circle. These little girls came,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
when invited, with phrases and sentiments carefully
drilled, their small minds already agitated by the possibility
of future favors. They bored and exasperated
their intelligent, if imperious and highly strung, hostess;
the more so that her courtesy must be unwavering, lest she
remind them of their inferiority in rank. But Alexandra
slapped her when she was angry, and hugged her when
the tide of her young and ardent affections rose, indulged
in ribald merriment at the rigid Spanish etiquette of the
court, the chill magnificence of the ceremonial rooms,
of the army of splendid guards and chamberlains and
lackeys, and the many other inconsistencies with the
daily democracy of the court-yards and the general external
dinginess and internal discomfort of the wealthiest
house in Europe. But to the Emperor she accorded
an unwavering respect, and she always amused him.
When, after the terrible loss of his only son—a tragedy
which practically banished his wife from his homes—Ranata
was first ill, then melancholy, clinging to her
chosen friend day and night, he had given his indifferent
consent to the American remaining in the Hofburg until
his daughter could live without her. That time had not
yet arrived, and although the incongruity of an American
inmate of the Hofburg sometimes entered the carefully
occupied brain of a monarch whose traditions would not
permit him to receive the bourgeoise wife of the greatest
of his subjects, and bade him ignore the distinguished
in art and letters, yet was he so grateful for any cause
that might lessen the problem of his youngest born that
he deferred indefinitely a half-cherished protest. He
believed Alexandra’s influence to be wholesome, and he
dreaded the scene which he knew must follow any attempt
to reduce the friendship to a more formal footing;
Ranata had pounded shrieking on his door more than
once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>So the years had passed, the children had played and
studied together, and been satisfied with their lot, and
no specific excuse had ever arrived to interfere with an
arrangement to which even the Emperor became too
accustomed in time to question.</p>

<p>After Alexandra’s physical trouble was over, Mr. Abbott
had insisted that she spend her summers on his
Hudson River estate, where he could see her daily, make
sure she passed the greater part of her time out of doors,
and preserved her Americanism. He had no objection
to her close friendship with the Hapsburg, for he had a
far-seeing eye, moreover fully appreciated the education
she would have under the royal tutors, the simple food
and habits, and, not of the least importance to this erratic
American father, the strict discipline to which the
heiress of many millions would be subjected. But he
invariably informed her, every year when he escorted
her to the steamer, that the first time she returned with
any “airs,” any reduction in the sum of her Americanism,
that would be the last she would see of her beloved
Ranata. Doubtless the advice was salutary, as all advice
is; but Alexandra from the first had perceived
the advantage her Americanism gave her over the born
subjects of royalty. Not only did her national exemption
from the courtier’s deference and her unconscious
indifference to future favors exercise a wild and picturesque
charm, but her exciting yarns of Western adventure,
spun for the most part out of a fertile imagination,
her astonishing games, labelled “American,” won
her the unswerving admiration of Ranata and almost
conquered the jealousies of the other little girls. As
she grew older she became fully aware that her influence
over the Archduchess, aside from the deep mutual affection,
lay in her fine careless independence and her utter
unlikeness to anything in Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>The influence of the girls on each other was of mutual
benefit. The deep serious nature of the Archduchess,
with her centuries of storied impressions, her lofty sense
of duty, even in her most rebellious moments, did much
to remodel the lighter nature, the slenderer mental and
ethical equipment of the American girl. On the other
hand, the absolutely fearless outlook of Alexandra, her
unswerving American point of view and republican ideal,
combined, as she grew older, with a close knowledge of
European politics, her habit of thinking for herself, her
mere tolerance of Old World standards and traditions,
her eager interest in new thoughts and movements,
early awakened emulation in the brilliant Austrian,
made her eager to lengthen her vision, to comprehend
the thought of the more sensible of the liberated women
out in the world; finally taught her to project herself
beyond the royal horizon, to feel and to know how it
was with humanity in its multitudes.</p>

<p>Alexandra watched the two personalities in her friend
grow and flourish coincidently; the one uncompromising,
traditional, bigotedly loyal to her house and condition;
the other tragically human, womanly, broad, generous,
passionate, sympathizing with the masses in their struggle
for happiness.</p>

<p>As Ranata grew older, the two women in her held
many an excited controversy; there were hours of profound
depression, discouragement, rebellion, abhorrence
of the royal tread-mill, and a wild pagan love of mere existence.
Encouraged by Alexandra, she had taken an
early stand against matrimony. Twice, however, she
had submitted to her father’s wishes, and permitted herself
to be affianced; but one of her princes dying before
the wedding-day and the other disgracing himself, she
announced that she had now done all that could be expected
of her, and should be permitted to remain single.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
The Emperor acknowledged the justice of her argument
and bided his time. Of his daughter’s intense inner life
he knew nothing, but he recognized that he had an
individual, not a mere princess, on his hands, and he
humored her as far as was in his power and consistent
with her conspicuous position. Liberty beyond palace
walls or royal enclosures was not to be considered;
tradition was tradition, even to the toothpicks on the
imperial table; moreover, although she bore no resemblance
to her mother, fate had spared her the growling
visage of the Hapsburgs, and, unlike most royal women,
she looked born to crown and purple. To the world she
was the princess, the goddess, a valuable asset for any
reigning house; and, tradition aside, the glorified ideal of
a vast and restless people must not be vulgarized, nor
even dimmed. But although she had her separate household
and a large income to spend on her wardrobe and
private fancies, the Emperor and his ministers had no
intention that a young, healthy, and beautiful princess
should carry out her romantic programme of being an
old maid. Happy in their ignorance of her resources,
they occasionally frowned over the shrinking list of
eligible princes. Early plans to place her on two of the
highest thrones in Europe had been frustrated by a
method so simple that neither the Emperor nor his advisers
had ever penetrated the mystery. Ranata had
treated each of the visiting young princes to a furious
exhibition of temper, which, taken in connection with
her red hair and American influences, appeared to them
to be of alarming domestic significance. The impression
was ineradicably fixed by the ingenious and terrible
tales poured into their ears by the fertile Alexandra.</p>

<p>Men had loved her, but as men love a picture or a character
in history; they hardly knew her better, for she was
too proud for intrigue, and conversation in the presence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
of a watchful court is neither sympathetic nor enlightening.
Moreover, her Obersthofmeisterin, the Archduchess
Maria Leopoldina, was the most anxious duenna
that ever had princess in charge, and the boldest officer
dared not brave that protecting wing.</p>

<p>Ranata had her dreams, her ideals, but she found her
heroes in history; a few ballroom flirtations completed
the sum of her interest in mere mortals. Knowing that
earthly love and passion were not for her, she did what
she could to forget their existence, occupied her mind
and wearied her body. The cruel afflictions of her family
chastened her somewhat, but she still had her hours
of intense rebellion, caught her imagination on the wing
in a future which never before had risen on the horizon
of what is technically known as “the Great.”</p>

<p>“This is certainly an improvement on the Hofburg,”
said Alexandra. “It is the only palace I have ever
seen that looks like a palace, not a museum, barrack, or
hospital; and Budapest is as picturesque a setting for the
kings and queens one reads about in books. The Danube
is not blue, but it moves—it moves—and its islands
are certainly green. The illuminations last night looked
as if the stars had come down to kow-tow to the <i>Hohenzollern</i>.
He has indulged in much affectionate rhetoric,
but has not yet broken loose. I wonder if he will to-night?”</p>

<p>“He is sure to, I should think. And I understand
that he fell on Count Andrassy’s neck this morning with
a rhapsody of Count Julius—to whom we certainly owe
the strongest tie that now binds Hungary to us. What
children the Hungarians are to be so flattered by this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
visit! They could have shown no greater enthusiasm
for a Charlemagne.”</p>

<p>“He is the one picturesque figure in Europe, my
dear.”</p>

<p>“And the one man who could have outshone him is
dead! The Hungarians worshipped Rudolf; the peasants
will not believe that he is dead; but this romantic
hot-blooded people must be enthusiastic about somebody,
and my father is too old. William is young; he
looks the Emperor; he is as ambitious as Napoleon; there
is an idea abroad that he dangles the scales of Europe
in his fingers. Oh, if I had been born a man!”</p>

<p>The two girls were standing on the balcony of the private
suite of apartments formerly occupied by the Empress
Elizabeth when playing the part of Queen of Hungary.
Down on their left, beyond the Danube with its
mighty bridges, was the beautiful and busy city of Pest.
Opposite them, on the most precipitous height of Buda,
were the ruins of the citadel. The palace, a vast and
symmetrical pile of nearly a thousand rooms, crowns the
lowest ridge of a mountain-range which slopes in irregular
masses to the river. Behind rises the long shoulder
of the Schwabenberg, its arm curved downward in the
north to grasp the Danube.</p>

<p>The great hills were brilliant with autumnal color;
many boats were on the river; the world was promenading
on the corsos; the flags streaming from every window
were gayer than the woods. Far below, at the foot
of the Palace Hill, in one of the cafés on the quay, the
girls could hear the music of the Chardash, and held
their breath as its wild note of longing changed to furious
appeal.</p>

<p>“This is living!” said Alexandra. “I feel romantic
for the first time in my life. Can’t we stay here?”</p>

<p>“It is perfect. I should be happy—almost; content if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
<i>he</i> were not here. But he must have taught the very
Hungarians the hollowness of their fictitious love for
my father. They have too much to forgive! They
never will forgive it. He is old. He has suffered greatly.
They pity him. That is all. And William knows
that. He has chosen this moment of uneasiness in
Europe to come here, looking the invincible young monarch,
bursting with arrogance and daring and the success
of his reign. No wonder the susceptible Hungarians
think him the chosen of God, and assured of infinite conquest.
Did you see the <i>Pester Lloyd</i> this morning?
‘<i>Till now it is the minds of the Hungarians which, with its
own mind, Emperor William knew how to conquer, but
he evidently knows as well how to conquer the hearts.
This he proved to-day once more, and we can only give him
the assurance that of all the languages in the world, it is
the language of the heart which in Hungary is best understood.</i>’
Oh, if I were a man!”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t let a little thing like that stop me. Your
brain is as good as his, and you have all the courage of
all your ancestors. In more ways than one you are like
him who prompted the old bishop to cry, ‘Sit fast, Lord
God, or Rudolf will occupy thy throne!’ Times are
times, but I don’t believe that all your talents were given
to you for no purpose.”</p>

<p>“I believe in the blind law of cause and effect. It is
only in my wildest moments that I have dreamed that
the first Rudolf and Maria Theresia circled low when I
was born and shook a bit of their golden dust into my
brain-cells—I hate to talk nonsense! Here come two
carriages across the bridge, the first of the guests, no
doubt. We had better go in, it is a quarter to five.
Mind you are careful not to allude to my father here as
‘The Emperor.’ That is a great point in Hungary.”</p>

<p>“If fate ever should whirl you to the throne, Ranata,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
for Heaven’s sake have dinner at a Christian hour. I
have indigestion for a month every time I come back
from America.”</p>

<p>The girls, who had stepped out on the balcony in the
broad light of afternoon, ignoring the protests of Maria
Leopoldina, who, rather than carry the mausoleum of
her charms into the sunshine, had retired in dudgeon,
were dressed for a great banquet to be given at five
o’clock to the guest of the King of Hungary, the German
Emperor. The Archduchess, who, with some reason,
had come to the conclusion that life with her was to
be a sequence of weeds, interrupted by intervals of uncertain
duration, varied her black with white only.
Nevertheless, she was one of the best-dressed women in
Europe, and only her patient tire-women knew the infinite
range of her wardrobe. “I often sigh for color,”
she confided once to her American friend, “but I am
too superstitious to venture. And perhaps it is as well.
My rôle is the princess of the antique, the traditional
pattern. In white I look ready for a memorial window
or a bas-relief in the Augustin.” To which Alexandra
had replied practically, “To say nothing of the fact that
it makes your own coloring twice as strong as it would
be above a brilliant plumage.”</p>

<p>Certainly the gown of white velvet embroidered with
pearls and silver which she wore to-day in honor of her
enemy enhanced her statuesque appearance, and gave
her sharp black brows, the scarlet of her lips, and the
brilliant masses of her hair an insolent effect of being
able to supply all the color that a dazzled beholder
could endure. The almost fierce incongruousness of her
coloring might have defeated her attempt to convince
the world that a mere princess dwelt within that virile
shell, had it not been for the cold regularity of an
Egyptian profile carried loftily above a form of antique<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
height and mould, and a skin so white that despairing
man had vowed there was sacrilege in the thought of
its being put to mortal use. Her gray eyes were alert
and so expressive that she had formed the habit of holding
them half closed, and her black lashes were very
thick. She had inherited her hands and feet from her
Spanish ancestors; while not out of proportion to her
great height, they were so finely fashioned that they
looked too small for serious work. Her trick of eyebrow
and shoulder, when animated, may have indicated the
persistence of the French blood brought in by Francis
of Lorraine. Nature, unspiteful for once to royal women,
had given her the infrequent best of her ancestors, and
even modified the not unpleasing nose that Elizabeth
of Brunswick had presented to the Hapsburgs. Ranata
had immense strength, had been ill but once in her life,
hardly ever had experienced the sensation of utter fatigue.
Her horsemanship was as remarkable as her
mother’s had been; and when she appeared in the Prater
beside the equally accomplished Emperor, it was a sight
that no man ever forgot. She broke in her own horses;
when in the country, frequently groomed and saddled
them. After Alexandra, they were her only intimates,
and she had known her keenest happiness when riding
eight hours of the day through the forests of Upper
Austria.</p>

<p>Alexandra never accompanied the Archduchess on
her longer walks and rides. She was an accomplished
horse-woman and a resigned pedestrian, but she had
the frail physique of her race, and had been born of a
hard-working fashionable mother with none of that profound
sense of parental responsibility so ingrained in
the European from queen to peasant. She was handsome
rather than beautiful; her eyes were too analytical,
her mouth betrayed too pronounced a scorn of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
shams of life, her whole expression was too keen and
humorous to compare victoriously either with the lofty
exalted style of the Archduchess Ranata Theresia or the
impassive harmonies of fashionable standards. But her
eyes and hair were the brown that took lights from the
sun, her features were delicate, high-bred, full of character
and energy. Her figure was light, round, active;
when compared with any but Ranata’s it was sufficiently
tall. In her way she was as complex as her friend of the
tremendous and conflicting elements drawn from every
civilization in Europe, but her salient and unquestioned
characteristics were loyalty and sincerity. She dressed
exquisitely, and the thousands she spent yearly in Vienna
had long since established her popularity.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p>Alexandra pressed her hand on the table in a flutter
of nerves, to which she was little accustomed. But they
had vibrated painfully more than once during the dinner,
although, with all her experience of courts, she had
rarely been present at so magnificent a scene. The
immense Throne Room, or Great Hall of Ceremonies,
of perfectly simulated yellow marble, relieved only
by white wood heavily incrusted with yellow bronze,
seemed to quiver in its flood of amber light. The three
chandeliers were huge inverted stacks of golden leaves,
with no false note of crystal. The few women present
were superbly dressed, and covered from crown to waist
with the jewels of centuries, but they made an indifferent
showing beside the barbarous magnificence of the
Hungarian magnates. Every other man at the table,
except the cardinals, was in uniform: the King, the
Archdukes, and the Emperor’s suite, in the Prussian;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
the few members of his household whom Franz Joseph
had ventured to bring to the jealous capital of his most
uncertain possession, and the Grand Stewards of the
Archdukes, wore an Austrian uniform; and the Ambassadors
were in fullest dress. But it was evident that
the fiery independent spirit of the great nobles of Hungary
recognized no uniform except that of a glorious
extravagance. Their fancy ran riot in color, in textile,
in form. But whether in thick brocade, delicate or
gorgeous of hue, in cloth of gold or silver, in white satin
fitting like a cuirass and studded with jewels, or in silk
so heavily embroidered with gold that it creaked like
an armor; whether the long velvet cloak, trimmed and
lined with priceless fur, its embroideries representing
years of labor, its buttons and chains of big uncut jewels,
was worn, or used carelessly as a background, there was
nothing in Europe, not even in Russia, to compare with
them. The headpieces of fur, the plume fastened with a
jewelled rosette, were under their chairs, their high boots
and silken small-clothes were likewise eclipsed for the
hour, but there was more than enough of them to make
the great golden room look like a page of old Hungarian
history. So their ancestors had sat at Árpád’s table a
thousand years ago. The hair of these men might be
shorter, but it is doubtful if they varied in another external
detail. Their faces were mobile, excitable, sometimes
very clever. A few looked like men of the great
world, although in that costume it was difficult to look
like anything but the feudal lord ready on an instant’s
notice to blow the trumpet in his villages and lead his
bondsmen to battle.</p>

<p>As their fiery glances wandered from the Archduchess
Ranata Theresia to the German Emperor, from the beautiful
woman who reminded them of their lost Rudolf to
the dashing young monarch they so passionately admired,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
a man after their own indomitable Hungarian
hearts, they seemed to create an atmosphere of uneasiness,
of premonition. Alexandra could imagine their
swift transition from extravagant courtesy towards their
aged King into the wildest excitement of which the
modern man is capable; and endeavored to hope that
William would behave himself. The young magnate
on her right, Count Zrinyi, was evidently a very excitable
person. He had from various causes approached
the verge of explosion several times. Never having
met anything like this cool American girl, he had fallen
madly in love with her; the blood flew to and from his
face, his jewelled armor creaked, and twice he dashed
the tears from his eyes. Alexandra would have imagined
herself in one of the Nights of Arabia had it not been
for the intervals of rational conversation, when, seeing
himself mirrored in the clear eyes beside him, and fancying,
as many a wiser man has done, that it was a kindred
soul he saw, he had talked of the grievances of the
Hungarians and their determination to have their own
way in their own country. At present they were engaged
in the extermination of the hated German language
and the universal substitution of the Magyar.
It mattered nothing that less than half the population
of their country spoke Hungarian, that the spirit of
Roumania still hovered over the land beyond the Theiss,
that there were whole villages where the language was
never heard, and that Croatia and Slavonia hated them;
the intense national pride and spirit which had endured
for a thousand years, weathering every conquest, every
humiliation, as ardent under the two centuries of Turkish
rule as during the climax of their glory under Matthias
Corvinus, had gathered fuller strength since the
Revolution of ’48; and the determination was growing
daily to give emphasis in every possible way to the individuality<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
of this most individual of European states.
Let those pitch their tents in Hungary who would, but
they must learn and use the Hungarian language or
feel themselves the aliens they were—Austrian officers
not excepted.</p>

<p>Alexandra yielded to an impulse, not so much of
coquetry as of curiosity; she expressed approval of his
patriotism in the beautiful Magyar tongue. She had
avoided German instinctively, and they had talked in
English—like most of his class he was accomplished in
many languages. For the moment she regretted her
experiment. He trembled violently and turned white.
It was then that he shed his first tear.</p>

<p>“You are <i>not</i> cruel!” he murmured. “You have enraptured
me! How kind—how wonderful. It is said
to be the most difficult of tongues. Did you learn a few
words, perhaps, before coming to Hungary, knowing our
greatest weakness—”</p>

<p>“Dear me, no. I studied Hungarian, as one of many
languages, with the Archduchess. She studied it as a
matter of course.”</p>

<p>“That is a very practical explanation,” he said sulkily.
“If I had had time to think I should have known.
Queen Elizabeth,” he looked as if he would have raised
his plumed and jewelled <i>kalpag</i> had it not been under
his chair, “bewitched Hungary upon her first visit by
speaking perfectly the Magyar language. She took a
great fancy to a young Hungarian girl and invited her to
become a maid of honor, but when she discovered that
she had been educated in Paris and had almost forgotten
her native language she sent her home to learn it, and
would not receive her into her household again until she
was proficient. We have never forgotten that. And
Rudolf! it <i>was</i> his language—we refused to believe that
he knew how to speak German.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>“Do you regret Rudolf?” asked Alexandra, in the
tone she might have used to demand his opinion of the
soft music in the gallery. Again she had touched powder
with her wicked torch.</p>

<p>“Regret Rudolf?—<i>Rudolf?</i>” He took himself in hand
and proceeded more calmly in a moment. “Mademoiselle,
I regret the Crown Prince, like many others, for personal
reasons, and, like the whole of my country, like all
Europe, in fact, for grave political reasons. He was so
warm, so genial, so fascinating—the best of good fellows,
the most simple and unostentatious of princes, and, what
all princes are not—we have one at this table, mademoiselle—a
gentleman to the core. He loved Hungary
as much as Hungary loved him. Had he lived there
would be no straining at the bit now; we should be content
to wait. Had he lived, there would be in Europe
to-day no uneasy anticipation of our poor old King’s
death. And not only could Rudolf make himself beloved
by everybody, but there have been few better brains
born to thrones—or in spheres where brains are more
abundant. He would have sown his wild oats, poor
chap!—and have made a great ruler. Then our guest
would have had a rival worthy of his mettle. Now he
has none.” With one of his abrupt transitions he continued:
“And such tact! In all the years that he came
to us and held his little court here in Buda, or was a
mere sportsman in his hunting-castle, he never made
a mistake. Do you know that the King actually has his
drinking-water brought from Vienna? And the very food
we are eating—and the cooks! Bah!—I’ll eat no more.
It is your fault, mademoiselle, that I did not think of
it sooner. I never go to Vienna. When he is here—our
King—I honor him, for he is old and good and kind—now!—but
you will acknowledge, mademoiselle, that
he insults us unnecessarily when he brings with him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
water and meat, vegetables, fruits, to this land flowing
with milk and honey.”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps he does not like milk and honey. I
detest both myself. And while I am willing to admit
that your language is the most beautiful in the world—a
union of velvet and steel, of music and running water
and of the sonorousness of distant thunder—yet, my
dear Count, still will I give the palm to Vienna for
water. It always tastes and sparkles as if it were gushing
still from its springs in the mountains, and I am delighted
that the Emp—King brings it along.”</p>

<p>The Hungarian looked at her speculatively. He was
not a fool, and recognized her difference from the women
to whom he was accustomed, although he did not
pretend to understand her. The mystery, and her curious
treatment of his love-making, made him more
thoughtful than usual. He was about to feel his way
towards a new channel of attack when his eyes encountered
the heavy black-framed visage of the King’s heir,
and his ardent brain leaped in a new direction.</p>

<p>“Do you know what that man has done to-night?”
he murmured furiously. “He has left his wife at the
station in a railway carriage, while he dines here as the
guest of the King! I only pretend to touch his hand!
Do you call that a man—to make a woman his wife, the
mother of his children, and treat her like his mistress?
If he had not the courage to renounce his pretensions to
the throne and live like a gentleman, why did he marry
her? Would such a thing be done in your great country?”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, we do not have morganatic marriages,”
said Alexandra soothingly. “It certainly was inconsistent
of him to marry her.”</p>

<p>“It is very awkward for us. We acknowledge no
difference between husband and wife in Hungary. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
that man ever does come to the throne, his wife will be
our Queen—”</p>

<p>“Rise!” said Alexandra, “the King is on his feet.”</p>

<p>And now the King had made his pleasant toast to the
illustrious guest, the room had rung with enthusiastic
“<i>Élyens</i>,” and the German Emperor was facing his audience
in a stillness so profound that others besides Alexandra
longed to have him begin a speech which all knew,
from the defiant almost impish light in his eyes, was to
be something more than the voluble rhetoric commonly
heard at royal tables. He had been in the highest
spirits all the evening, joking with the King, at whose
right he sat in the middle of the long table, and with
every one else in his neighborhood, temporarily charming
even his avowed enemy, the Archduchess Ranata
Theresia, who sat on his right. In the light-blue and
white uniform of a general of the Austro-Hungarian
army, his breast covered with orders, he had never
looked handsomer; and in the atmosphere of approval
that he loved he was ready—everybody felt who knew
him—to do and dare anything. But the most expectant
were unprepared for his actual performance.</p>

<p>He began at last, turning with deep respect to the
King, and a slight excitement was perceptible in his
strident tones.</p>

<p>“It is with a feeling of the deepest gratitude that I
receive the hearty welcome of your Majesty. Thanks
to the invitation of your Majesty, I have been able to
visit this splendid town, whose grand reception nearly
overwhelmed me.” He paused as if again overcome by
the memory, then launched his first thunderbolt at the
tempestuous hearts of a people who but half a century
before had almost succeeded in wresting their great
kingdom from the monarch whose guests they were to-night—a
people whose fathers had died cursing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
name of Hapsburg, and petitioning Heaven for the success
of the Hungarian arms.</p>

<p>“We are following at home,” announced the German
Emperor, “with <i>sympathetic interest</i> the story of the
knightly Hungarians, <i>whose patriotism has become proverbial</i>,
and who in a glorious past did not hesitate to
sacrifice their blood—for the holy cross,” he added with
pious haste. “Names like Zrinyi inspire the hearts of
German youths to the present day. We witnessed with
<i>sympathetic admiration</i> the festival of the thousandth
birthday, which the Hungarians, surrounding their beloved
King, celebrated with such astounding pomp.
The proud architectural works of your great city give
evidence of her artistic spirit, and the bursting of the
bonds of the Iron Gates has opened a new way for commerce,
and <i>has ranged Hungary as an equal among the
great and the most highly civilized nations of the Earth</i>.”</p>

<p>By this time the Hungarians were heaving like the
sea. They had left their seats and were pressing towards
the Emperor, silently, that they might not lose a
word of his utterance; and it was evident that only etiquette
restrained their emotions. Never before, not in
modern times at least, had a monarch so flattered them.
Not for centuries had they been saluted as a practically
independent state, unhyphenated, for once permitted to
stand alone under the crown of St. Stephen, the hated
double-headed bird brushed lightly aside. The air
seemed shaking with deep political import; more than
one man was trembling violently within his barbaric
splendors. The Emperor pulled himself up abruptly,
and turned once more to his host, whose face, indignant
and aghast, composed itself suddenly to courteous attention.
William’s tones had been rich with sympathy
for a race passionately admired. They now softened
with filial affection. “But what has made the deepest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
impression upon me, particularly during my reception
in Budapest, is the enthusiastic devotion of Hungary
to your Majesty. And not only here, but in all Europe,
above all among my own people, does the same enthusiasm
for your Majesty glow—an enthusiasm which
I venture myself to cherish, in looking up, after the
manner of a son, to your Majesty as my Fatherly
Friend.</p>

<p>“Thanks to your Majesty’s wisdom, our union stands
firm and unquenchable, a blessing to our people; for it
has meant the peace of Europe for many years, and it
will continue to do so for many more.</p>

<p>“Enthusiastic devotion to your Majesty—of this I am
sure—dwells as firmly now in the hearts of the sons of
Árpád as when they cried to your Majesty’s great ancestor,
‘<i>Moriamur pro rege nostro!</i>’”</p>

<p>He paused a moment before crying the hurrah for the
King, which all present expected as a matter of course
would be given in German. But William, under that
apparently tactless exterior, capable of the profoundest
diplomacy, had a still surer bolt in store. Raising his
goblet on high, his eagle glance flashing from end to
end of the pale company, his passionate tones thrilling
the most antagonistic heart present, he cried:</p>

<p>“Giving expression now to these sentiments, we will
put all we are capable of feeling, thinking, and praying
for your Majesty into those words which every Hungarian
utters with his latest breath—<i>Élyen a Király!</i>”</p>

<p>As the words rang out in the Magyar language, so
jealously beloved and preserved, from the lips of a
monarch whom duty had never commanded to cope with
its difficulties, the tongue the King, his host, ignored,
there was an instant of almost stupefied silence. Then
some one gave an <i>Élyen!</i> as wild and abrupt as a battle-cry,
the spell broke, the hot blood of the Hungarians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
leaped to their heads, they forgot etiquette and crowded
about the Emperor, shouting until the marble walls
rumbled the echo. Their wild glances never wandered
to the convulsed face of their King, nor from the triumphant
eyes of the German. Several of the younger men
and equally excited women stood upon chairs that they
might see him better. Then for the first time in that old
palace there rang out the word most hated in Hungary,
“<i>Élyen a császar! Élyen a császar!</i>” (Hurrah for the
Emperor!) Then again that most musical and thrilling
of vocatives, “<i>Élyen! Élyen! Élyen!</i>”</p>

<p>Alexandra took her Count firmly by the arm and
pushed him into a chair. “You don’t look very strong,”
she said, “and you will faint if you are not careful.”
Her own knees were trembling as she took the chair beside
him, but she proceeded coolly, “What an infant you
are to be taken in by the cleverest man in Europe—”</p>

<p>“He is the greatest man living,” stammered Zrinyi.
“This is a great moment in the history of Hungary,
mademoiselle. It should be painted and hung beside
Munkacsy’s <i>Árpád</i>, or the <i>Sally of Zrinyi from Szigetvár</i>.
He is the man for us!—the man for us!”</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt every mustache in Budapest will stand
on end to-morrow. What a pity you have none.”</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle!” he cried, outraged at her flippancy;
but she was moving away.</p>

<p>She had looked once at Ranata during William’s speech.
The Archduchess, as the Hungarians pushed forward,
had withdrawn from the Emperor’s side and stood leaning
against the wall, her head bent, her arms rigid. Her
face was expressionless, but, Alexandra commented, her
hair had never looked so red.</p>

<p>William, as the King, experiencing satiety, led the way
to the reception-rooms, turned his head rapidly in all
directions, taking a final survey of the scene of his latest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
triumph. His glance roved over faces angry, approving,
terrified, adoring; encountered the amused stare of the
American with haughty indifference, then rested suddenly
on the face of his young hostess. The Archduchess
had dropped her mask. Her head was thrust forward,
deliberately waiting for the moment when William’s
eyes must meet hers. When they did they lingered.
The Hapsburg’s eyes blazed with a hatred so implacable,
with a defiance so reckless and contemptuous, that
the Almighty’s best-beloved experienced a shock. It
seemed to him, for the first time in his triumphant career,
that he heard the steel of another will clash menacingly
with his own. Sustained in his dizziest flights by his
honest belief in his earthly mission, insolently aware that
he had the best brain in the royal hierarchy, the most
splendid energy, a capacity for work never surpassed,
he was fully convinced that he had but to develop his
gifts, use all his vigilance and what patience he could
find in him, to realize his vast ambitions. But for the
moment, in the presence of another human will, and
that the will of a woman, he experienced a chill rising of
the imperial flesh. He forgot his majesty, flung his head
high like an irritated stallion, glared back his defiance,
and jerked his eyes away. In a moment he was reminded
of his manners.</p>

<p>“Your arm, your Majesty,” said the cold voice of his
hostess; and in silence, but with an impressive exhibition
of royal self-control, they walked side by side through
the first circle-room into the blue drawing-room. He
was mightily uncomfortable, however, for in some subtle
feminine way she made him feel as if she were towering
above him by nearly a foot. It seemed to him that she
grew an inch with every step, that her little crown of
black pearls was rising higher and higher; and when
he finally shot an apprehensive glance upward, almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
laughing aloud at his folly, he was relieved to find that
her nose was still on a level with his brow. But she was
making the most of her height, which, with the diadem
on her lofty head and the immense train dragging behind
her, would have made a man of her own inches look
insignificant. It is doubtful if William ever breathed
deeper relief than when, a few moments after arriving
in the drawing-room, he was informed that the carriages
were waiting to take himself and his suite to the train,
and that he must make his adieux.</p>

<p>The guests had scattered through the long line of
rooms. Many went out upon the balcony to watch the
royal carriages and mounted escort cross the illuminated
bridge, and the roar of cheering thousands seemed storming
the hill. The royal party retired almost immediately,
and Alexandra followed the Archduchess to the sitting-room
of her private apartments. Ranata’s ladies
had been dismissed, and she had closed the dressing-room
door on her tire-women. She was standing alone at the
window sobbing convulsively. The room was ringing
with <i>Vivats</i> and <i>Élyens</i>, for it was too hot to close the
windows.</p>

<p>Alexandra pushed her into a chair, removed the pins
and pearls from the heavy mane of hair, and sprayed her
head and wrists with cologne. In a few moments the
Archduchess had commanded her tears. She threw
back her head and looked down upon shouting Pest with
a sullen glare.</p>

<p>“What wouldn’t I have given to be able to wring his
neck!” she said in a moment. “How dared he! At my
father’s table! What insolent cruelty—he, who need
fear no one living—to come here and fling his dynamite
into the weak foundations of this poor old Empire! I
wish to God I were on the thrones of Austria and Hungary.
I’d pit myself against him without a qualm.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
It would be two of our ancestors over again and joy in
the fight—I believe that in one of his exalted moments
he enrolled Frederick the Great among his ancestors.”</p>

<p>“Well,” began Alexandra, but Ranata did not hear
her. She had risen and was standing in the middle of the
room, her long hair flaming about her. To the American
girl, her quivering slender figure looked ready for a coat-of-mail,
her head for the helmet. “I can’t help admiring
the brute for flinging his designs in our faces,” she exclaimed
furiously. “Did my father understand? The
Hungarians?—The Emperor dies. Franz Ferdinand—<i>Franz
Ferdinand!</i>—succeeds him. The Empire, bound
together by rotten threads, begins its disintegration
with my father’s corpse. Do you remember the rapacity
of Europe, that greedy horde of vultures, after the
death of Charles VI.?—Frederick’s swoop upon Silesia?
William, ‘in the manner of a son,’ only awaits the death
of his ‘Fatherly Friend’ to devour Austria to the gates
of Vienna. And Hungary? Could you not see his bait?
Hungary quiescent—Hungary once more an independent
kingdom, or with himself as its nominal and indulgent
ruler!—Oh, for another Pragmatic Sanction!”</p>

<p>“I have a plan—if you will sit down quietly for a few
moments and listen to me. It is a practical plan, and I
know it will appeal to you.”</p>

<p>The Archduchess resumed her seat. “Well? Tell it
to me quickly. I am panting for a practical idea. But
the blood is blazing in my head.”</p>

<p>“William has made a deep impression on the Hungarians,
and no doubt they understood him plainly enough.
But impressions can be counteracted. He leaves here
to-night, and your father will be in no hurry to invite
him again. Do you remain here this winter, instead
of returning to Vienna with the Emperor—announce
that you have found no city so fascinating, that you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
cannot tear yourself away; entertain constantly and
brilliantly; let loose all your bottled personal charm—show
them that you are the sister of Rudolf; be seen in
public; make a royal pilgrimage through the villages.
The Hungarians resent unceasingly that the Emperor
spends but a few weeks of the year in Budapest—and
they look upon Austria as a mere annex of the great kingdom
of Hungary. They will be flattered—your slaves;
with your personality, if you will come down off your
high horse, they will end by adoring you—especially if
you give them a royal good time. So much for the present.
When the time comes! When the time comes!
When the Empire shakes and William threatens, all you
will have to do will be to have a King’s Mount ready, fasten
the crown of St. Stephen securely on your head, ride
up the mount, and wave your sword to the four corners
of the earth. All Hungary would break into deficient
Latin and shout, ‘Long live our Lady and King!’ The
dust of Maria Theresia would quiver at that old war-cry—and
she is no more forgotten here than in Austria.
You will be a fool if you throw away the greatest opportunity
ever offered to a woman cursed with royal
blood.”</p>

<p>“It would almost be like meditating an act of usurpation,”
muttered the Archduchess; but her head was
thrust forward, her eyes were glittering. “But the alternative!—who
knows? It might be for the best. It
may be my destiny. These Hungarians! There are no
people in the world so easy to arouse by appealing,
not to their nerves and passions, but to their chivalry
and highest ideals.” She stood up again in her excitement.
“Do you remember when Maria Theresia, desperate
and almost helpless, with Europe sucking at every
vein of the Empire, the Austrian army an army of corpses—do
you remember when she came here, young, beautiful,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
pregnant, eloquent, and appealed to Hungary to
save her, how the magnates not only went off their heads
and cried that they would die for her, but inspired more
than their own retainers with their enthusiasm?—until
from every mountain, from regions so remote that William
had never heard of them, there poured down tribes
so wild and terrible that Europe fled in dismay. If Austria
exists to-day, she owes it to Hungary—and no Hapsburg
since Maria Theresia has ever acknowledged the
debt. And again—when Napoleon bribed and my great-grandfather
appealed, how they spurned the one and
poured out their blood for the other—who was neither
picturesque nor grateful. Throughout their history the
Hungarian character has been astonishingly consistent,
their nationalism has been as unwavering, in spite of
conquests and immigrations, as that of your own countrymen.
They are as independent as republicans and
as loyal as the British. But it makes them the easier
for tact and diplomacy to manage. If I convinced them
that I really loved them, that I was capable of the right
sort of rule—oh, go now. I will think all night. Come
down early, will you?”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">V</h3>
</div>

<p>When Alexandra presented herself at the door leading
to the apartments of the Archduchess at ten o’clock on
the following morning, she was informed by the groom
of the chambers that her Imperial Highness awaited her
in the “Hungarian House.” Her arms were full of
newspapers and her eyes sparkled with excitement.
She ran down the little staircase just beyond the door
and out upon the first terrace, blinking in the brilliant
sunshine, but pausing to look at the cool gray Danube,
the splendid bridges, the gay city opposite; then wandered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
about aimlessly for a few moments, her enjoyment
still keen in the freedom of the Hungarian atmosphere,
the unapproachable beauty of Buda, ancient city of
kings. The hill which the palace crowns is so abrupt
that its many terraces have the effect of the hanging
gardens of old; and its pillared galleries of white stone,
its wide and narrow flights of steps leading down the
steep hill-side, through parterres of flowers or thickets of
green to the great gates on the Danube, its upright unshaded
lawns and winding ways lost in romantic gloom
seduce the imagination away from the crimes that have
been committed within the fair walls above, the prisoners
that have languished in the dungeons beneath.
When the most dazzling of suns floods the tremendous
white front of the palace, with its carved and pillared
rotunda, its straight and stately wings, the one bit of
color in the crown of St. Stephen above; when the statues
of kings seem quivering with life and the water of the
fountain flies upward in an eager bursting of its bonds to
leap outward on all sides and rush back as eagerly, in
a confused and glittering mass of foam and spray, then
must the most casual sojourner in the city of Pest,
smoking his cigar in the shades of its corso, comprehend
the proud spirit of Hungary. The royal palace of Buda
is the embodiment of that pride, personal and national,
the glorified symbol of a thousand years of steady and
upward persistence, while battling with every misfortune
that can assail a devoted nation.</p>

<p>“No wonder Kossuth lost his head when he was lord
here for a few minutes,” thought Alexandra. “If he
hadn’t—if he had sent Görgei on to Vienna—well, may
I be in at the next death!”</p>

<p>She descended a wide flight of marble steps on the left
of the palace, then another, and approached the little
“Hungarian House,” built into a portion of the ancient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
wall, almost hidden by trees as old. It was a gay little
tea-house of primitive Hungarian architecture, its inner
walls decorated with panels of native embroidery, the
whole effect light, Oriental, frivolous.</p>

<p>Two of Ranata’s ladies were reading under a tree nearby.
The Archduchess was alone in the one room of the
house. Her eyes were heavy. It was evident that she
had slept little. They flashed, however, and she suddenly
sat erect as she saw the newspapers.</p>

<p>“Ah!” she exclaimed sharply. “What do they say?
I did not care to send for them, myself.”</p>

<p>Alexandra threw herself into a chair and rattled the
journals viciously. “I have come to read you a few
select extracts. Oh, he hit the mark—hit it in the bull’s-eye!
I am told they are in such a state of enthusiasm
and excitement over there that if he hadn’t left last
night he wouldn’t have been able to get out of Hungary
at all. Here’s the first gun: ‘The majestic words will
find an echo in all parts of Hungary, which will ever remain
in the debt of the great Hohenzollern, who has forever
conquered the soul of every Hungarian; ... the love
and gratitude of the Hungarian nation will follow the
guest of our King wherever he goes.’ But that is mere
rhetoric. Listen to this: ‘In every line there is so much
heart and so much sympathy with the Hungarian nation,
its glorious past as well as its promising future, that it
seems not the language of politics only, but of a loving
friend, on whose well-meaning we may ever rely! Perhaps
it will give cause for reflection in those parts of the
German Empire which have been prone, without cause,
to cast blame upon Hungary, now that they see with
how great a sympathy the German Emperor expresses
himself in our behalf.’ Here is another: ‘As a political
assurance it is the grandest which ever came from the
lips of the Emperor William himself.... Many wounds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
are healed by those words, which put an end to such
calumny.’ There are two more. Of course there are
columns, but I have marked the significant extracts.
‘The toasts of yesterday will be written in the annals
of the nation with letters of gold, and sustain and rejoice
the soul of future generations. No Hungarian will read
the warm and inspired words of the German Emperor
without a joyful and a burning heart. No strange monarch
has ever spoken to our nation with so much feeling.’
This is the last: ‘Where did the German Emperor
find those colors for his palette? Why, they are our
own colors! Where did he find that tune? It is the
pulse of our own hearts! God bless this great monarch,
who knows so well how to appreciate our
striving country! We utter these words of parting
to him with a never-dying gratitude!’ There you
are!”</p>

<p>“I tasted gall with every word, but I am glad they
have been printed, for they will help me to accomplish
my object. I need strong arguments—my request to
remain here alone will be a tremendous innovation. I
shall send these to my father at once, that he may have
read them before our interview. They may or may
not have been shown to him. If I personally request
it, he is sure to read them, no matter who is at his
elbow.</p>

<p>“The sole consolation,” she continued after a moment,
“is that William is not a Catholic. I doubt if
the Hungarians would ever accept a Protestant king.
Perhaps if Kossuth had been a Catholic he would have
been stronger in his exile.”</p>

<p>“William may have to turn Catholic yet, or Socialist,
to keep his throne and get all the other things he wants.
Surely religion—the incidental husk of it—cannot mean
much to a brain like that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>“He would never let the Jesuits rule him,” said the
Archduchess bitterly. “They have been the curse of
the Hapsburgs, and their restoration constitutes Metternich’s
chief claim to infamy. But their power over
rulers in this enlightened age is incredible—perhaps,
however, royalty is not so much enslaved by the Church
as by its ancestors. Even I, to whom the Catholic
Church is but one of many inherited forms, long since
rejected by pride and reason—even I am sometimes
the victim of that ancient sea of superstition that murmurs
in the soul. I can see my father wash the feet of
the poor and feel nothing but amusement. I can see
him march bareheaded in the Corpus Christi procession,
and only fear that he will get a sunstroke—his face
was purple last June. But there are times in the cathedral,
on great occasions of ceremony, when the mysterious
colored dimness, the long sonorousness of priests,
the glorified pageant, the divine music, and the intoxicating
incense seem to liberate all the ghosts in my soul
and send them to my head. Then I have a confused
sensation of being in a past century—old doors are
opened, old ecstasies, terrors, desires, creep forth. I
long to prostrate myself and grovel, to scourge myself
into a spiritual delirium, to feel the foot of the Church
on my neck. Then creep out the old lusts of cruelty,
of tyranny, of torture—what a mere ghost of power a
civilized monarch has to-day! Can you imagine that
there have been moments in my life when I regretted
that?—when, under the spell of Holy Church, I have,
for a moment, been a composite of the worst of my ancestors?”</p>

<p>“You are always picturesque, and you always make
me rejoice that I am an American and not descended
in the royal line. But I am astonished that you ever
permit your reason, your personality, to be submerged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
in such a fashion! I should think if there was one woman
who could seal up her ancestors and leave them to
moulder where they belong, it was yourself. You are
not morbid, except in erratic, incidental, ancestral
streaks.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I am morbid in the usual sense, for I
have too good an appetite and take too much exercise.
But I am bound to have deeps and fissures in my soul,
for the centuries have cut them there; and what <i>must</i> be
in them sometimes affects my imagination. And my ancestors
have a curious fascination for me—the idea that
they may or may not have the power to shape the destinies
of the living. There have been moments when
I have been disposed to prostrate myself amid the remains
of their mortal part in the crypt and demand their
intercession. Did you know that Maria Theresia used
to make her daughters, on the eve of marriage, go down
into the crypt alone at night and pray among the coffins
of their ancestors? There have been times—very rarely—when
that idea has appealed to me with an almost
irresistible force.”</p>

<p>“For Heaven’s sake stay here in Budapest, where you
can live in the sun. You have grown mouldy in the
Hofburg this last year, and your ancestors have had it
all their own way. I thought you had got over that
sort of nonsense long ago. This is the result of William
and a sleepless night.”</p>

<p>The Archduchess laughed. “Perhaps. I am willing
to suppose that my predecessors have troubled me less
all these years than they might have done without the
fatal antidote of your American humor. Nevertheless,
I have no right to be faithless to them, and I would
not forget them if I could. And I find them much more
satisfactory to contemplate than most of my living relatives,
who, as a rule, have neither morals nor brains.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>“I agree with you there. When Death lays his iron
hand upon a mortal’s power to bore, his virtues rise and
sit upon the corpse. That is the secret of the superstition
which makes us think kindly of the dead. Do you
mind if I read a letter from Fess? I have been too excited
even to open it.”</p>

<p>“Pray do.” Ranata smiled with both sympathy and
interest. Then she sighed. “I believe your brother
is the only person I envy—I mean the only person
I’d be if some fairy would bid me choose. He
has his destiny in his own hands. He has done such
wonderful things! He is famous and powerful; his
future holds the most astounding possibilities—and he
is only thirty-one! Oh, your America! Where will
you stop? And what will you do to poor old Europe?”</p>

<p>“Now you’re talking! Come down out of your
niche, with the worm-eaten past behind it, and identify
yourself with us. Therein lies your only salvation.
William and my brother have some great scheme
on foot; I don’t know what, but I know that
much from a few words I happened to overhear between
Fess and my father. William and Fessenden!
They could turn the world upside down if they chose!
Well?”</p>

<p>The Archduchess was leaning forward, her eyes blazing.
“An alliance between William and your brother?”
she exclaimed. She composed herself with a manifest
effort, and added: “It is really remarkable—I know
your father and Mrs. Abbott so well, and yet your
brother—I have never seen him—not even his picture.
You say those cuts in the newspapers during your war
with Spain—”</p>

<p>“Were probably a composite of Roosevelt, John
Jacob Astor, and Cervera. Fess, like my father, has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
never had his picture taken. He hasn’t the patience,
and says he has no desire to display his weak side to the
world—that the weak side of a man is more likely to
come out in his photographs than not. It is hardly
remarkable that you have not met him. First those
years in South America, putting blood and iron in place
of wind inside the Monroe Doctrine; since then he has
had too much to do at home to come to Europe, except
for two months in summer, when he brings a canoe and
a knapsack. About his only other recreation has been
the Spanish War. But this letter has the Berlin postmark.
I thought he had gone back. Let me see what
he has to say.”</p>

<p>She glanced through the short letter. “He is not
going back at present. He has one of his periodical
attacks of disgust for business and details, and will
tramp over here for a month or two longer.”</p>

<p>“Ask him to come here—to Budapest,” said the Archduchess
sweetly. “It is high time we met. And as he
is the most distinguished of young Americans, I should
like him to be one of my court. I intend to have the illustrious
of all sorts about me here, in art, in letters, in
music, and irrespective of noble birth. I intend to show
Europe what a court should be.”</p>

<p>“You <i>have</i> thought it out! And the Emperor? Are
you sure? It is my turn to have misgivings. He will
see many objections. There is no one so rigid in his
traditions.”</p>

<p>“I shall stay,” said Ranata shortly. “He would never
go so far as to follow some illustrious examples and shut
me up. If the worst comes to the worst, I’ll threaten
to go to America and live there.”</p>

<p>“Good! At last my seeds are showing their little green
heads. Now I know you will succeed in whatever you
put your brain to. You may count on me. I’ll even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
engage to help you alienate Fessenden’s affections from
William, and he is devoted to him.”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">VI</h3>
</div>

<p>The private apartments of the King, at the southwestern
extremity of the palace, correspond with the
suite on the southeastern corner, which had been furnished
for his wife, and was now occupied by Ranata.
He had sent his daughter word that he would receive her
alone at four o’clock, and when she was announced he
was standing on the balcony, looking down into the
distant street behind the palace. There were excited
groups of people in the street, and he guessed of what
they talked. From the many old houses, fine and simple,
on the still loftier hill which faced him, and from
neighboring slopes above and about, from the villas on
the precipitous heights of the Schwabenberg, the flags
still floated, and it seemed to him that the German outnumbered
the Austrian in the ratio of three to one. As
he turned to greet his daughter, she saw that his face
was more harassed than usual, but he advanced with the
grace and courtesy which, even in his old age, were unsurpassed
in Europe. The years which had robbed his
heavy Hapsburg features of what beauty youth may
have lent them had spared his light erect figure, his exquisite
hands and feet. His genial eyes kindled at sight
of Ranata, but he kissed her lightly and handed her to
a chair. Had she been born twenty years earlier she
might have been his idol, and as it was he admired no
woman more and was proud of her. But not only had
misfortunes, humiliations, reverses of every sort, and
the cruellest personal afflictions that in number and
degree have ever assailed a monarch atrophied his heart,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
but he feared to find even the eidola of happiness in this
gifted creature, lest the knife be driven into the responsive
breast and his own earthly expiation of the
sins of all his ancestors be the more complete. His ancient
habit of temperate affection for his older and married
daughters excited no misgivings. But if Ranata
had never been permitted to know him intimately
enough to love him, she sympathized with and admired
him. If enthusiasm, hope, passion, were dead within
him, he was equally without bitterness, without resentment,
without jealousy, and in theory, at least, without
indifference to the least of his subjects. Even the
cruel insult of the day before had not stirred him to
anger. He had lost and lost and lost from the day he
had ascended the throne, and the driving of Austria
from the Germanic Confederation, and substitution in
supremacy of Prussia, must forever be associated with
his name. In William’s brief career Germany had been
reorganized, strengthened, incredibly promoted in industrial
importance. William received an occasional
snub and reminder that he was two-thirds mortal, but
to associate the idea of failure with him was as unthinkable
as to imagine him in the robes of a monk
praying for humility. Personally the Emperor and King
could afford to pass his pyrotechnics by with a smile,
but there was more to consider than his own sensations,
and he was meditating an early retreat that he might
consult with his Austrian ministers.</p>

<p>The room, with its olive walls and its lowered awnings,
was cool and dim, but Ranata deliberately rose and
placed her chair where the light would fall fullest upon
her. Then she turned her powerful gray eyes on the
Emperor, and he moved slightly; like the rest of the
world, he usually saw his daughter’s eyes through their
lashes, and it was now at rare intervals that he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
reminded of the problem of his youngest born. He
suddenly remembered that when he was, the laurels
fell from his brow, and involuntarily he braced himself.</p>

<p>“I need not ask you, sir,” began Ranata, “if you
recognized the calculation under William’s impetuosity
last night. There is no doubt that he made the deepest
possible impression on the Hungarians, that, if present
conditions continue, no other subject will be discussed
for months to come in this dissatisfied country, even to
its remotest villages. At first I was merely humiliated,
enraged, terrified. But I have thought all night, sir,
and I have reached the conclusion that I have it in my
power not only to obliterate the impression he has made,
but to create one deeper and more persistent. His, he
may not have the opportunity of renewing—you certainly
are under no obligation to ask him here again.
This is my plan: let me live here and keep the Hungarians,
from magnates to peasants, constantly reminded of
the great love they bear you. If I can make them love
me, so much stronger will the bond be between this restive
country and Austria.” She leaned forward and spoke
as solemnly as if taking an oath of allegiance. “I know
that if I am given my way I can preserve this state to the
Empire, avert the calamity which all Europe expects to
follow your death. I am willing to pledge every hour
of my life to this great mission. I believe that every
human being is put on earth to be of use in some form or
other. Assuredly usefulness—to the uttermost moment—is
demanded of us. So far I have accomplished no destiny
whatever, and I do not for a moment believe that
I had so many of the characteristics of my house concentrated
in me for no purpose—although in endeavoring
to find reconciliation to my lot I have sometimes
argued myself into a belief of the blind law of cause and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
effect. But I do not believe in it. I am here for a purpose,
and the time has come for the accomplishment of
that purpose. <i>I will not marry.</i> I am quite well aware
that it is your intention to arrange an alliance for me before
my thirtieth birthday; but there is no mortal power,
sir, that can force me to the altar. I make no threats.
I have no intention of resorting to any desperate measures.
I am strong enough in myself. I simply will not
marry. But I now represent a sinful waste of high usefulness.
Moreover, the emptiness and monotony of my
life have become quite unbearable. I ask that I may be
permitted to exert, for the good of my country, the best
of those qualities which have come to me from yourself
and my ancestors.”</p>

<p>The Emperor stared at her for a moment without
speaking. He was as astonished as it was in his power
to be at anything. Then he gave her the answer she
expected.</p>

<p>“It is a subject for deep thought on my part, my dear
child. A week from to-day I will give you my decision.
Meanwhile there is no reason why you should not remain
here if you desire it.” Then, as Ranata merely
continued to transfix him with her determined eyes, he
continued hastily: “It is a great and generous idea, and
I am much gratified to learn that you take so deep an
interest in your house. I had thought you absorbed in
books and horses. But are you sure you would not pine
in this strange country? Remember, you would be
obliged to send all your Austrian ladies home, and surround
yourself with Hungarians. I, as you know, hardly
dare to bring an aide among these people, so fierce in
their national pride. The women are as proud as the
men, and very independent, quite unused now to leadership
of any sort. Every Hungarian woman in the
higher aristocratic circles is a sort of queen, is a social<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
law unto herself. You are accustomed to the courtier,
to the flexible—”</p>

<p>“I am sick of it! And as tact is one of the prerogatives
of royalty, I hope you will give me credit for my
share. As for being lonesome, nothing on this earth
can ever approach the suicidal ennui I have experienced
in the Hofburg. As for Schönbrunn, I loathe the
sight of it. This change is necessary, sir. Moreover,
Alexandra will be with me. And if there were
drawbacks—do you think your daughter is the person
to consider trifles when a great object is to be
gained?”</p>

<p>The Emperor’s eyes happened to rest on her hair. It
flamed against his green walls. “Red-haired women
are dangerous,” he thought. “It is well to keep them
occupied. Why on earth doesn’t she marry?” Aloud
he repeated, “A week from to-day, Ranata, you shall
have my answer.”</p>

<p>Ranata, having spent her first round, was content
to retire. She knew that a definite answer was not
to be thought of until the Emperor had asked the
advice of his ministers. “But the idea made an impression
on him, no doubt of that,” she informed
Alexandra, whom she met in the garden. “And so
did I. If I didn’t tell him I would stay here whether
or no, I don’t think he has any doubt of my intention.
If he won’t give his consent, I’ll spend all my
money and all yours; and his refusal of the necessary
allowance is the worst he would do, for he wants no
more scandals. To remove me by force—and I’d
leave Hungary in no other fashion—would be to make
the world believe I was mad, and he has had enough
of that. Besides, poor man, I made him think I should
go mad if I didn’t have my head for a while.”</p>

<p>“We are a wicked unprincipled sex when we want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
our own way,” commented Miss Abbott. “But to
get it—that is the main thing; especially when there
is a good and great end in view.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">VII</h3>
</div>

<p>On the following Thursday Ranata was not surprised
to receive a note from her father asking her to grant an
audience to his minister Count von Königsegg, who
went to Budapest for the purpose.</p>

<p>“Now for it!” exclaimed Alexandra. “Of course he’s
brought a corkscrew. Are your brain-cells hermetically
sealed?”</p>

<p>“His corkscrew will do him no good. Nevertheless,
I feel a certain apprehension—feminine, I suppose. He
is the one person who has done me the honor to believe
that I might play with politics in a manner to disconcert
his clever manipulation of my father, and I have
shown my dislike of him by ignoring his existence, as
far as possible. He detests me; nevertheless, if I am
able to convince him that I have no purpose behind the
one I have advanced, I believe he will make no opposition
to my plan: he has no desire to see William in the
Hofburg and himself in obscurity. He will not have
the least objection to using me—he is the sort to feel
quite sure that a woman can be disposed of the moment
a man sees fit. But if he thought that I had any ulterior
design—”</p>

<p>“Try American diplomacy on him if you get in too
deep—speak out bluntly and agitate his guile. Let him
squirm himself into a corner, and then tell him to speak
out or get out.”</p>

<p>“I sometimes feel half an American,” said the Archduchess
Ranata Theresia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>Down the long front of the southeast wing of the
palace is a suite of some ten or twelve rooms, large and
small, beginning with the private dining-room and finishing
with the red reception-room. The yellow Throne
Room, or Great Hall of Ceremonies, runs parallel, occupying
the width of the circle-room and audience-chamber,
which flank it at one end, and of the circle-room and
blue drawing-room of its southern termination. From
this last circle-room opens another, which in turn leads
to the private apartments occupied by the Queen of
Hungary when there is one. The windows of these
apartments, closed during the clouded last years of
Elizabeth’s life and since her death, were now open to
the sun; the hangings were losing their musty odor, and
the numerous belongings of Ranata had already obliterated
the little individualities of the Empress. Ranata,
whose strong soul had little in common with the unhappy
woman who had permitted life to crush her, had tender
pity for her mother’s memory, but no great amount
of sentiment. Not only were the rooms dingy and oppressive,
but her own individuality was too strong to
exist comfortably in surroundings stamped throughout
many years by that of another; she had made up her
mind that the day after her father’s decision, whatever
it might be, she should refurnish the four rooms of
her suite; and when the Emperor’s letter arrived they
were full of stuffs, sent up from Pest for the approval of
her Imperial Highness. Some pieces of curious brocade
were pinned into the panels, and the dusty old rugs had
vanished. The girls, ordered to remain in strict seclusion
during this week of deliberation, had entertained
themselves in their own fashion.</p>

<p>“I cannot receive him here,” said the Archduchess,
when she received the humble petition of the great minister
for an audience. “Besides, I don’t want to. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
I could help it no one should set foot in my personal
surroundings—atmosphere—who was even uncongenial
to me.”</p>

<p>“It is a family failing,” said Alexandra dryly. “But
I always admired Ludvig for putting his head out of the
window when he had to have his tooth pulled rather
than have the royal atmosphere polluted by a dentist.
It may have been uncomfortable for both, but it was
magnificently consistent.”</p>

<p>“I am not Ludvig, and I have no intention of making
a fool of myself,” replied the Archduchess, also with
some dryness. “I’ll receive him in the tea-room; I like
the blue walls. Shall I wear black or white? I look
more imposing in black.”</p>

<p>“Oh, look your guileless best—white, by all means.”</p>

<p>Therefore, Ranata caused herself to be arrayed in a
bewildering gown of a pellicular Eastern stuff, much
embroidered, and billowing about her feet in the fashion
of the moment. She wore her heavy hair in a gold net,
and a string of pearls about her throat, exposed to the
base. She looked girlish, if not ingenuous, and very lovely.</p>

<p>The Archduchess Maria Leopoldina, Obersthofmeisterin,
or Grand Stewardess, of Ranata’s Household, together
with one of the ladies-in-waiting, the Lectrice,
and Alexandra, disposed themselves just beyond the
door of the tea-room as the carriage which had been
sent for the minister appeared on the bridge below the
palace.</p>

<p>“It is fearfully hot, and he’s probably cross,” said
Alexandra from the balcony. “Better begin with iced
coffee and predispose him to amiability of a sort.”</p>

<p>And thus it came about that the subtle and wary
minister tarried for a few moments beneath the youthful
presentment of his sovereign in the brave uniform of the
Hungarian Hussars, while four women smiled upon him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
and flattered him with many little attentions. Then
he went in to his fate.</p>

<p>Ranata had carefully arranged her features before the
mirror, and had succeeded in banishing the expression
of haughty dislike evoked by the mere mention of her
enemy. When he entered her presence her eyes were
half closed as usual, but their visible surface was soft.
She dared not receive him with cordiality, but a frank
admission of an enemy’s stewardship of the plums she
desired involved a certain amount of graciousness.</p>

<p>“This is very kind, your Excellency,” she said gently,
giving him her hand to kiss. “Had you permitted any
one else to bring me the Emperor’s decision, I should
still have been tortured by many doubts; but now I
shall know my fate at once.” She leaned forward slightly
and deepened her emphasis, her lashes lifting a little.
“Of course I shall abide by what you and my father
think best; but remember it is little less than life or
death to me. No one knows better than you the dreary
monotony of the lives of royal women. You know how
my mother stood it! You who know men, and must
know women so well, must have suspected that had it
not been for the constant scandals which seem to be the
peculiar curse of my house, I might have taken my life
in my own hands before this; but the very years of suppression
I have endured, ordered by a sense of duty to
the dynasty, has strengthened and deepened that feeling
until it rules my life. Now, for the first time, I have
had an inspiration, which, if permitted me to act upon,
will fill my days with no dishonor to my house. Of the
good I may accomplish by remaining here I will not insult
your understanding by dwelling upon. But, although
we never seem to have been friends, I am so well aware
that I am now in your power that I have given you this
glimpse of my inner self—so be merciful,” she added, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
if with an attempt at playfulness, while a smile rippled
through her eyelashes.</p>

<p>For a moment the minister did not reply. He was
not a man easy to nonplus, but he had come to test his
strength with the haughtiest woman in the Empire, and
he found himself staring at the loveliness of a softly
impassioned girl. He had come to flatter, and his very
spine thrilled at subtle compliments delivered in a voice
whose cold music had become as sweet as a harp some
one was playing in a distant chamber. He had come
to sound with the elastic skill of time-honored methods,
and his scornful Archduchess had thrown wide a window
of her soul and left him blinking. He had entered with
the smile and the supple backbone of the courtier, but
quite aware that he might retire with his tail between
his legs, and a fully matured enmity in his fertile brain.
He was by no means sure of her even now, and he studied
her face—she had lowered her eyes that he might;
but there is no influence so potent, no wine so heady,
as the flattery of royalty to courtier. And the—perhaps
unconscious?—flattery of this woman of all women,
of whose coldness those nearest to her complained,
seemed to rise like a rosy mist to his brain. He swept
it back, however; there was too much at stake. Although
he did not hate her as much as she imagined, for
he was philosophical where women were concerned, he
had recognized in her a powerful individuality, a violent
will, which, if given its head, might deprive himself of
the sweets of existence.</p>

<p>“I am deeply flattered and grateful, your Imperial
Highness,” he said finally. “Truly, like his Majesty, I
had believed you to be absorbed in the purely intellectual
life—”</p>

<p>“Oh, I was! I was!” exclaimed the Archduchess,
with sad ardor. “But pardon me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>“His Majesty is deeply moved by an idea as great in
conception as it is indicative of an ardent loyalty to the
dynasty. He was overwhelmed when you advanced it,
and could give you no answer at the time. But he has
thought of little else since, and has deigned to consult
his ministers on the subject. As it was manifestly impossible
for his Majesty to return to Hungary within so
short a space of time, he did me the honor to appoint
me his messenger. Even my visit will probably attract
more attention than is desirable, but fortunately Count
Zichy had invited me for the shooting, and I have taken
pains to speak freely of the ostensible object of my visit
to Hungary. Of course, it is my duty to kiss your hand
in passing.” He paused and looked at her with a frankness
which rivalled her own. “Your Imperial Highness,”
he said impressively, “personally, I am deeply in
favor of your remaining here. I believe you can accomplish
all you so nobly and intelligently have conceived;
and the time will come when we shall have need
of the strength and loyalty of Hungary! More than
three hundred thousand of the army are drawn from
this state, and there are no better fighters in Europe.
It is quite true that the seat of government should be in
this division of the Empire, which is little less in area
than all the other divisions put together. The Hungarians
are a more progressive, enterprising, more <i>modern</i>
race than the Austrian in certain respects; on the
other hand, they still have much savagery in their blood;
they have been so shut out from personal competition
with the higher civilizations of Europe that they have
too rich a soil for the seeds of degeneration. Their
very lack of morality has always been robust, and to-day
the Hungarians believe the city of Budapest to be as
superior to Vienna in morals as it is in industrial activity.
While Austria is retrogressing, disintegrating, Hungary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
is progressing, has all her old virility, ambition, unconquerable
patriotism. Moreover, when Ferdinand was
elected King of Hungary, he promised to live here, and
the Hungarians have never forgotten that promise, never
ceased to resent the neglect of their capital. His Majesty’s
brief compulsory annual sojourn that he may
keep the letter of the Constitution which commands that
the King shall spend a portion of every year in Hungary,
merely exasperates them—trade as well as society.
Therefore your suggestion to remain here, promptly
upon the extravagant hopes raised in their imaginations
by the juggling of the German Emperor, and to use your
great gifts constantly to remind them of their loyalty to
the dynasty, has struck me as one of the shrewdest instances
of statecraft which has ever come within my
experience. Perhaps”—as the Archduchess blushed
and gave a delighted little exclamation—“perhaps I
should say that <i>was</i> the manner in which his Majesty’s
communication impressed me. It was such an idea as
might have come to Maria Theresia, wise in statecraft
from her youth—but—it is true—you have never condescended
to politics—apparently had not given them a
thought—”</p>

<p>“I have certain inherited instincts. And is not the
capacity to rise to an emergency also a part of my inheritance?
It is true that I have taken little interest in
politics. My books, my music, my out-door life, my
brilliant American friend sufficed me. Being uninvited,
I could not meddle in affairs of state without bringing
one more calamity upon this unfortunate house; and
this dynasty, I do assure you solemnly, has all the loyalty
and the fealty of my soul. With this sudden idea of
mine politics have nothing whatever to do. I know
the current history of Europe and I know William,
God forbid that I should be expected to talk politics<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
with these Hungarians. It would be to turn the palace
into bedlam, and I am accustomed to the repose of
stellar voids. My only idea is to make them love me,
to win to myself what they gave to Rudolf, to <i>increase</i>—I
am more frank with you than with my father, and
choose the word advisedly—the popularity of the dynasty.
I shall entertain magnificently and constantly, give
them such a winter as they have always claimed to be
their right and never have had. I shall travel and make
the peasantry merry. I shall give up my studies and
throw myself into this programme heart and soul. But
it is a purely feminine programme. If there is anything
else I can accomplish, I know that your Excellency
will instruct me.”</p>

<p>And here she proved the possession of really great
talents. Pleading a necessary word with her Obersthofmeisterin,
she left him alone for a few moments.</p>

<p>He drew a sharp but silent breath. He had never
seen a woman look more like an angel, and he knew no
woman in whom he was so convinced the devil made extended
sojourns. He understood for the first time why
she had disciplined her spirit to rise triumphant above
that breadth of jaw, the grand sweeping lines of her
body, above her diabolical hair; for he was too astute to
question her integrity on this point. In a flash he understood
why she would not marry. But ambition?—and
a permanent and ever-widening outlet for that tumultuous
spirit, that repressed and violent nature? Was she
sincere for the moment? Had he been sure of even that
he would not have hesitated to give his cordial endorsement
to her plan. But he had persuaded the Emperor
that unless they could be positive she meditated no act of
usurpation upon the succession of her unpopular cousin,
she must not be permitted a liberty with which she
might even before that event plunge all Europe into war.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
The Emperor, who asked no more of life but peace, had
told him to go to Budapest, investigate the mind of his
problematical daughter, and then act in accordance with
what his Majesty believed to be an unfailing judgment.
What a tool she might be, his Excellency had thought.
She looked like anything but a tool. It suddenly rushed
upon his brain that he had never seen a woman who
looked so surely born to sit upon a throne. <i>Why not?
Why not?</i> And if he were her good friend now, if he,
whom she knew to be the arbiter of her destiny, if he
were the one to place the sceptre within her reach—who
so fitted to serve her hereafter? to rise higher and higher
in power?—for this woman would take no puppet consort.
Might not Europe welcome such a solution of an
agitating problem? Not William, perhaps, nor Russia;
but by that time William and Russia might be too occupied
with each other to scramble for plums in the Austrian
pie. And a young and beautiful empress, with an
intelligence capable of assimilating all the statecraft her
ministers chose to impart, always of imposing dignity,
irreproachable, her heart and soul given to her state and
people, her beauty the constant inspiration of the artist,
would she not be worshipped by her subjects, and appeal
to the interest and chivalry of Europe? If she had
the tact to appear nobly indifferent to any such result
during the lifetime of her father; if the Hungarians, immediately
upon the death of their king, arose as one
man and proclaimed her queen, she would tower above
reproach or criticism, the most picturesque personality
in the world, far more certain of holding the Dual Monarchy
together than Maria Theresia with the aid of the
Pragmatic Sanction; for to-day the majority of nations
wanted peace and the preservation of the Austrian Empire.
Franz Ferdinand might attempt a struggle for
his rights, but it was more likely that the army of Austria<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
would march to this woman than against her. It
well might be that she alone could rouse England as well
as Europe to defeat the designs of William. With Franz
Ferdinand on the throne, war, internal and external,
Königsegg believed to be as inevitable as the messenger
of death in the palace of kings.</p>

<p>He had experienced a shock from crown to heel. The
Archduchess re-entered the room and graciously asked
him again to take the chair opposite hers. He commanded
his eyes, but permitted his voice to tremble as
he made his first cautious move.</p>

<p>“Your Imperial Highness—it is my bitter regret that
I have never been permitted to know you before—would
to God that you were a man—what a solution of all our
difficulties!”</p>

<p>“But I am not a man,” replied the Archduchess indifferently.</p>

<p>“It has flashed upon me—humiliating thought to
my sex!—that the greatest of the Hapsburgs was a
woman.”</p>

<p>Ranata knew as well as he did that the greatest of the
Hapsburgs was Rudolf the First, but this was not the
moment to establish the claims of the dead, and she
demanded, “Has it taken you all these years to make
that discovery, or have you been too busy making history?”
Her first words were delivered in the tones of
one moved to cold analysis; her last were accompanied
by an enchanting smile. She had drawn her eyelashes
together, lest a flash escape; she was quite aware
of what was passing in his agitated brain, and her own
heart beat high.</p>

<p>The minister drew another long breath. He dared
not express himself more plainly. He was absolutely
in the dark as to whether she understood him or not.
A false move and he might be the laughing-stock of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
Empire. Failure to comprehend this imperial sphinx
and his future might be passed in heaven or upon his
estates for all the world would know or care. Muttering
an obsequious request, he rose abruptly and walked
down the long suite of rooms. As his back turned Ranata’s
statuesque face twitched with an almost ribald
mirth and her eyebrows peaked in a manner which
made her look truly diabolical; but when the minister
returned she looked pleading and girlish, a trifle nervous.</p>

<p>He stood in front of her. “Your Imperial Highness,”
he said, solemnly, “I came here in much doubt, for you
have never permitted me the honor of knowing you.
But this brief interview—the most enlightening of my
life—has convinced me of the wisdom of your plan,
and of your ability to carry it out in every detail. I
believe that you alone can hold Hungary to the throne
when the hour comes which we dread so deeply, for
there is no question that you can reduce this gallant
passionate race to a state of willing slavery. Your brain
will become more and more fertile with expedients; but
I should be deeply honored if you would maintain a
regular correspondence with me, for this is an experiment
with unimaginable consequences, and I shall give
it my unflagging attention. There is much I may be
able to suggest to you if you will deign to permit me.”</p>

<p>Ranata had too much tact to rise impulsively, for she
towered above the minister by not a few inches, but she
held out her hand and shook his warmly, and her face
was radiant. “I am so glad! I am so glad!” she cried
softly. “And you do not hate me! I have been so desperately
bored and hopeless that it has given me a certain
pleasure to make enemies—if only for the sake of
sensation; and as you were the most powerful man in
the Empire, it amused me to defy you. In your magnanimity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
you have forgiven me! If you knew how
grateful I am, how I thank you!”</p>

<p>His Excellency trembled, but he kept his head; how,
he never knew. “Your Imperial Highness,” he said,
“I, too, am a patriot. I am acting in this instance, as
in all others, in the service of the Empire. If, in addition,
I am to be permitted to act in the service of a
woman—of such a woman—madam, will you permit me
to retire?”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">VIII</h3>
</div>

<p>“We parted with mutual distrust, a mutual increase
of respect, even of tolerance, and a common determination
to make use of each other,” said the Archduchess
to Alexandra, as she finished the account of her interview
with the minister. They were alone in her salon.
“I reserved my Americanism for a future occasion, and
played the old European game of the cat and the mouse.
He is not in the least sure which is the cat and which
the mouse. Neither am I, for that matter; but I have
the advantage of knowing him better than he knows
me. However, here I am for the present.”</p>

<p>Alexandra drew a long and almost voluptuous sigh of
content. “No more awful evenings in the Hofburg!—whist
with his Majesty, or, worse still, with M. L.; a
little music; tittle-tattle about the same threadbare old
royalties, the last novel—French and wicked—the play,
the last baby—there are always several; yawns, decorum
<i>ad nauseam</i>; mad desire to lie down on the floor and
kick up your heels. Oh, just and beneficent Heaven
that sent William to Hungary with a wasp at his heel!”</p>

<p>“Let us forget William—and Austria. Where are the
cigarettes?”</p>

<p>The girls smoked in silence for a time, the Archduchess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
staring hard before her, after her habit, as if she were
poring over the cryptogram of the future. When the
short Russian cigarette had burned to its mouth-piece
she returned to the present.</p>

<p>“I suppose it will be wise to pay my new friend the
compliment of asking his advice about my Hungarian
household—about the Obersthofmeisterin, at all events.
I will write him an autograph letter to-night. What
tact I shall develop with a few weeks’ practice! I wonder
who the new duenna will be? But no one even he
approved of could be worse than Maria Leopoldina, and,
after twelve years in the arena with her, I flatter myself
I am more than a match for the most masterful he could
select.”</p>

<p>The Archduchess Maria Leopoldina, a member of a
younger branch of the House of Hapsburg, who had succeeded
the scrupulous but too obsequious English governess,
had been selected, after much anxious thought
on the part of the Emperor, consultation with his ministers,
and with his old friend the Princess Sarolta of
Windischgrätz, as especially fit for her delicate post.
The Empress’s prolonged absences from court, as well
as the inevitable suspicions engendered by her increasing
repugnance for contact with common mortals, made
it doubly imperative to give the headstrong young Archduchess
a duenna who would, by precept and example,
educate her conspicuous charge in the great responsibilities
of her position and curb any bent to eccentricity.
Maria Leopoldina, a conscientious woman of masterful
temperament but considerable tact, had done her work
well, and took to herself the credit of much that had
been evolved by the thoughtful mind of Ranata herself.
Nevertheless, there is no doubt that her early lectures,
delivered to an impatient but imaginative young princess,
had sown seeds which might have floated longer with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
more pliable guardian. For several years she insisted
upon the observation of the very letter of her great authority;
no friend could Ranata make without her approval,
no acquaintance talk with for five minutes alone.
The Archduchess had never appeared in the streets of
Vienna without her, but in the country, particularly on
Ranata’s personal estate on the wildest part of the Danube
in Upper Austria, where they were as secluded as
soldiers in a border fortress, she wisely allowed her
charge a good deal of liberty; and as the years went on
she relaxed by imperceptible degrees the rigor of her
sovereignty; she left the girl more and more to herself,
merely asserting her authority at discreet intervals, that
the rebellious nature confided to her should not experience
the temptations of freedom.</p>

<p>She knew that if she had failed to win her august
kinswoman’s heart she had her respect and gratitude; for
not only had she early suggested to Ranata the benefit
she could confer upon her house by playing the rôle of
the lofty and immaculate princess, devoid of common
weakness, inaccessible to common temptations, but she
had inculcated the great art of self-command, and in the
depths of this profoundly accepted lesson Ranata had
discovered the strength to endure her life, accept her
colorless future, and dominate her nature by her intellect.</p>

<p>Between Maria Leopoldina and Alexandra there was
no love lost, but there was a golden and bejewelled
truce. Alexandra, even at sixteen—at which age both
girls attended court functions, although tutors and governesses
were in attendance for two years longer, under
the general supervision of the Obersthofmeisterin—was
too wise in the ways of royalty openly to defy this valuable
woman, who rejoiced in the absolute approval of
the Emperor and his ministers; and the Obersthofmeisterin,
who often longed to shake her and pack her off to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
America, dared not, in this one particular, brave the
wrath of her princess. During the first two years of
her reign, however, they were more than once perilously
close to open war, and a fatal rupture might have been
precipitated by the more impulsive Alexandra had not
Mrs. Abbott arrived in Vienna for her step-daughter’s
eighteenth birthday, and during a moment of extreme
tension. Grasping the situation and its dangers, Mrs.
Abbott admonished Alexandra severely, and made her
present the duenna with a magnificent set of diamond
stars—given out of the fulness of her heart on this the
most sentimental of birthdays. The present was peculiarly
welcome to Maria Leopoldina, who, herself the
youngest of her family, having married in her uncalculating
youth a junior member of an impoverished house,
was sadly deficient in that jewelled panoply which diverts
the eye from the shabby gowns of so many of
Austria’s noble dames. Moreover, this concrete illustration
of the vast wealth of the American girl inspired
respect, if not awe, and these sentiments were nourished
at decent intervals by other offerings of increasing magnificence.
As time went on, Alexandra, too, imbibed
the great lesson of self-restraint, and developed a high
impersonal way of looking out upon life; she ceased to
irritate the Hapsburg, and admitted her own debt as
well as that of her friend. Nevertheless, she had no
love for Maria Leopoldina, and was alive to all her foibles.
To Ranata’s remark she replied, assuming a severe and
elderly demeanor, elevating her head until the roundness
left her throat, from which her voice issued with a scraping
sound:</p>

<p>“Will your Imperial Highness kindly remember to-night
that the Princess Cockolorum is only entitled to
one minute of your august notice, as it is necessary to
remind her that her manner in public with Lieutenant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
von Poodle is unbecoming in a member of the Austrian
court, which has dignity if not morals? And will your
Imperial Highness exert yourself to remember that the
wife of the American ambassador, although no doubt
charming, is still an American? It is not necessary to
inquire after her entire family. And—my dear child,
your hair looks like a rat’s nest! I shall dismiss that coiffeur
to-morrow!”</p>

<p>Ranata laughed. “She should be glad of a holiday,
poor soul. I had rather be a poor prisoner of a princess
than a slave of a duenna like an Obersthofmeisterin—I
have an idea! Why not Sarolta? She is Hungarian.
She is in every way suitable. She would be <i>persona
grata</i> here, is loved and trusted by my father, and while
standing to the world as an impregnable outpost, would
really give me a free hand, and with all her cynical soul
enjoy the experiment. I shall write to her at once to
manage it—as only she can. That would be the last
thing necessary to make me feel as if I had been born
again. Now, Alexis, let us give our attention to these
rooms. I think I shall have cloth of gold in these panels,
and curtains of these Turkish embroideries. My writing-room
must be blue. Shall I have my bedroom in cloth
of silver and white?—and my dressing-room in these old-rose
brocades? And all the furniture must be new—nothing
ancestral here! There is an intoxicating freedom
in the air of Hungary—ah! I really do feel as if I
had been born again.”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">IX</h3>
</div>

<p>The Princess Sarolta was obscuring the moon with the
smoke-clouds of her big black cigar. It was nine o’clock—dinner
in the Királyi Palota was now served at half-past
seven—and the court could smoke behind the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
pillars and the vines of the long stone terrace beneath
the west windows of the private apartments of the King
without consideration of possible field-glasses on the
heights above. The Princess, who normally resembled
a mummy, looked more like a witch in her encircling
fumes, and her eyes glittered and blinked behind the
red disk of her cigar. They were black eyes, and their
fires in youth, and indeed long after Nature had given
her more than one admonishing nip and claw, had recklessly
leaped to so many other combustible hearts that
even now the court gossips disentangled the pulsing
tales of her past from others more commonplace. But
with wrinkles and man’s manifest preference for her conversation
had come not only reform but the evolution
of a severe and uncompromising code of morals. She
astonished Vienna for a number of years by the vehemence
of her criticisms and her treatment of certain noble
dames whose fires were still unquenched, or who found
in intrigue that taste of liberty which knocks alluringly
upon even the doors of Austria. With the mellowness
of approaching age the enthusiasm of the Princess had
tempered somewhat, and it was observed that she
grinned behind her big cigar when an after-dinner scandal
exhaled a faint perfume of novelty; but by this time her
fame as a she-dragon was securely established. Her
tactics, combined with a fortune inherited coincidently
with her reform, from a relative who had married a
wealthy and, as it proved, childless Jewess of Budapest,
gave her a unique and impregnable position which made
her the most natural guardian in Austria for a young
princess who had left her father’s roof to hold court in
his most conspicuous possession. The Emperor, who
was a little afraid of Sarolta, but who asked her advice
on all momentous domestic questions, bundled her off
to Budapest with a deep sigh of relief. Her reputation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
as a dragoness relieved him of much of the anxiety with
which he had entered upon this radical experiment, and
he had not chanced to take note of her mellowing. But
Ranata had, and, believing herself exempt from the
weakness to which the Princess still showed her teeth,
knew that she would have the real authority, while the
Obersthofmeisterin sat scowling in the foreground, her
wrinkles impassive above the chuckling within. As for
Count von Königsegg, Sarolta had begun his education
while unwrinkled, and not only had done him many
good turns since, but had taught him to believe that
there was one greater diplomatist in Austria than the
Princess Sarolta Windischgrätz, and that was himself.
Therefore when, after a hasty and pleading note from
Ranata, and a long and humorous petition from Alexandra,
she gave the minister to understand that it was
his wish she assume charge of his interests in Hungary,
it was but a matter of hours before her women were
packing her boxes. She had come to Buda in full possession
of his confidence.</p>

<p>The situation amused her intensely, but while she was
too wise ever to betray a confidence or to share her
amusement of a man with his enemy, yet she did not
scruple to use any secret she might possess when engaged
in the manipulation of human destinies. She
cared as little for Königsegg as for the Emperor, sentimental
memories being no longer insistent. But Nature
had denied her children, and she had a considerable
hoard of affection in her erratic but wholly human
depths. Now that Rudolf was dead, she cared more for
Ranata and Alexandra than for any one in the world,
and was determined, to use the phrase of her American
protégée, that they should have the “time of their
lives.”</p>

<p>To-night she grinned amiably at them from the depths<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
of a rocking-chair, long since presented to her by Alexandra,
which accompanied her wherever she went.
The party was a small one: the Obersthofmeisterin and
her charges, two young Hungarian ladies-in-waiting of
her selection, the Countess Vilma Festetics and the
Countess Piroska Zápolya, and two invited guests,
Prince Béla Illehazy, a magnate, who, in simple evening
dress, looked a middle-aged and somewhat humorous
man of the world, and Count Zrinyi, whose national fire
and still youthful ardors—he was thirty-five in years—had
given him over to love of an American on the night
of a great and memorable dinner. It had been decided
that the Grand Chamberlain and other court officials
were only to serve at great functions, and that those
who were in waiting upon the Emperor during his
annual sojourn were to give their services to the Archduchess
when she demanded them.</p>

<p>Zrinyi was leaning against one of the pillars, his black
eyes flaming down upon Alexandra, who smiled upon
him indulgently; she thought him a nice boy who might
be useful in the cotillion and in general advice of a lighter
nature. They were all discussing the momentous question
of the first entertainment to be given by the new
court.</p>

<p>The dictum of the Princess Sarolta, that it must be a
great ball, to which men and women should come in the
ancient dress of Hungary, had been received with approval
by all but Prince Illehazy, who scowled at his
girth.</p>

<p>“I thought I should burst the other night,” he admitted.
“And I must say that my native costume always
makes me feel more or less a fool. I suppose I
have lived too much elsewhere.”</p>

<p>“You are no patriot,” said his old friend, whose eye,
as it followed his, twinkled with some malice. “I insist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
that you give up Vienna and Paris this winter and
remain here as my private cabinet.”</p>

<p>“You may need help,” he murmured, and he looked
at Ranata.</p>

<p>“And we? Are we to wear Hungarian costumes,
too?” asked Alexandra.</p>

<p>“By all means,” answered Ranata for the Princess.
“I have already designed mine; the skirts and apron will
be of white lace, and the bodice of black velvet.”</p>

<p>“That will be your second stroke of diplomacy,”
murmured Alexandra. “But it seems to me that I
should be a screaming absurdity in an ancient Hungarian
costume.”</p>

<p>“Not if—not if—” muttered Zrinyi.</p>

<p>“Why not make it a fancy-dress ball, everybody to be
a personage of the court of Matthias Corvinus, during
whose reign Hungary reached the height of its splendor
and power and prosperity?” asked the Countess Piroska
Zápolya. She looked full at the Archduchess with innocent
blue eyes which were too widely opened for
frankness. She was excessively pretty, and her mouth
pouted like a spoiled child’s. She was a descendant of
that Stephen Zápolya, vayvode of Transylvania, who,
in 1526, after the terrible battle of Mohács, when Hungary
was threatened with annihilation by the Turks,
and her king lost his life, was elected to rule over the
distracted country by the faction which believed in a
native dynasty and peaceful relations with the enemy.
Another powerful faction elected Ferdinand of Austria,
and in spite of the occupations of the Turks, which gave
the Hapsburg as little authority as his rival, his dynasty
kept its grasp upon the shadow until it became substance;
while the son of the trooper who had been raised to a
position of such power and magnificence by Matthias
that his ambition knew no bounds, was unable to extend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
his rule beyond Transylvania, and his dynasty
ended in his son. His descendants, powerful magnates
as they were, had two enduring grievances: their inferior
descent as compared with that of the magnates whose
line ran back unbroken to Árpád and haunted the mists
beyond, and the ancient victory of the Hapsburgs. The
first grievance was little discussed, but no Zápolya permitted
himself or others to forget that his right to the
throne was as great as the Austrian’s. Impoverished,
and knowing little of the world beyond Budapest, the
present generation was even fiercer in pride than the
majority of their order, and bitterer in their hatred of
the Hapsburgs. They were wise enough, however, to
know that Hungary had not the strength for a native
dynasty, even could one be established without devastating
civil wars, and the father and brother of the clever
little maid of honor had been the first to fling open the
gates and drive out the wild waters of unrest towards
William of Germany. Count von Königsegg had advised
the selection of Piroska, for he believed she would
be hostile and a willing spy, and Sarolta had acquiesced
because she believed that herself and Ranata would be
more than a match for any disaffected young woman.
Outwardly the Countess was irreproachable. Her manners
were high-bred and charming; five centuries of intermarriage
with the best blood of Roumania and Hungary
had obliterated all characteristics of John Zápolya
except his ambition. She was lively and cultivated,
and there was nothing in her manner to betray her
hostility. She was the only enemy in camp. The
other maid of honor, Countess Vilma Festetics, although
proud and reserved, had loved the dead Elizabeth and
had transferred her large measure of passionate loyalty,
since unclaimed, to the princess who, in her great beauty
and greater isolation, seemed to her the most romantic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
figure on earth. Without humor or more logic than
the larger division of her sex, she was capable of martyrdom
for her ideals, however narrow. But she was
bright and shrewd, and never having trusted Piroska
Zápolya, suspected that she might be too high in the favor
of Ranata’s enemies. In appearance the young Countess
was of a type more often seen in Hungary than described;
she had neither the sparkling blond nor the
voluptuous brunette beauty which, with their womanly
figures and happy animation, have made the women of
that romantic country so famous. She was small and
slender, and her coloring was drab; under the hauteur of
her delicately cut pale face were the tense lines of tragedy.
Her breeding helped her to control a high and intolerant
temper. Of the most ancient blood in Hungary, poor,
high-spirited, and proud, she had seen nothing of the
world, but her high accomplishments and qualities, and
the affection which she had inspired in the Queen while
a child, had induced Sarolta to select her for what
the cynical elder believed to be a temporary post. She
was also glad to give the girl a few months of light-hearted
luxury, and would have included many like her had
it been possible.</p>

<p>“She is the sort that in a less enlightened day would
have used the poisoned bowl and then killed herself at
the foot of the altar,” she had said to Ranata; “but
she will be loyal to you, and when she has nothing on
her mind she can be very lively and young.”</p>

<p>“We have many costumes of the time in our chests,
Highness,” the Zápolya was saying. “I am sure that
Miss Abbott would look charming in one of rose-colored
velvet—to which she would be more than welcome; and
if you conclude to ask the Deputies, some tailor here
could use the others as models. We have also two or
three of the purple velvet costumes with the long gold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
chains, and the head braidwork of gold and pearls, worn
by two of the three hundred youths sent by Matthias in
the embassy to Charles VIII., King of France. If you
were escorted into the throne room by a great number
of pages in this costume, Highness, the effect would be
one of perfect loveliness.”</p>

<p>The Archduchess understood her perfectly, but she
felt her own strength, and was amused at the flash in
the American’s eyes.</p>

<p>Moreover, her mind grasped the peculiar advantages
which a fancy-dress ball would afford herself. She said
sweetly:</p>

<p>“The national costume during the reign of Matthias
differed little from that of any other reign, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“It merely reached its height of extravagance. The
national characteristics have always remained the same.”</p>

<p>“Then, if you will allow me, I will look at your costumes,
and, no doubt, find one that I shall be delighted
to copy.”</p>

<p>In spite of her hostility the little Countess was flattered.
She assured her princess, with something like spontaneous
enthusiasm, that she should order the costumes
brought to the palace on the morrow.</p>

<p>“I have a painting of Matthias in his robes of state,”
said Prince Illehazy. “I wonder will any one have the
courage to impersonate him? He was a mighty figure,
that son of John Hunyadi, and I have not the slightest
doubt that the blood of kings was in his veins. There
is no man in Hungary, alas! fit to wear his mantle, not
even at a fancy-dress ball.”</p>

<p>“He was a plebeian,” said the Countess Piroska, lifting
her little nose. “And even could it be proved that
John Hunyadi was the son of King Sigismund, all his
fame, even the medicinal water named after him, could
not obliterate the bar sinister.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>“The little cat!” said Prince Illehazy under his breath.
He replied, “When a man makes a success of his life the
bar sinister lends him the added distinction of picturesqueness,
and not only did the Knight of the Black
Raven have the blood of real kings in his veins, but Sigismund
united on his head the crowns of Imperial Germany,
Hungary, and Bohemia. Sigismund had his
faults, but he was the head of the Holy Roman Empire,
and neither he, nor his great son, and greater
grandson, need descendants to keep the family name
alive.”</p>

<p>“I suppose the ball must open with the Chardash,”
said Ranata hastily, and forbearing to glance at the
crushed Zápolya. “And I do not know how to dance
it!”</p>

<p>Zrinyi found his opportunity. “May I be permitted
a suggestion, Highness?” he asked. “The Chardash
has been ruined by society—is a miserable degenerate
thing. They sway and glide and languish. Have you
ever seen the peasants dance it? They have preserved
it in all its original simplicity, energy, and variety. If
you could see them—and then dance it here in the palace
as it should be danced—it is never vulgar, never
boisterous, merely virile, full of the abandon of a happy
and healthy people—”</p>

<p>“But how can I see it? I learn any dance quickly,
but I must see it.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow is a <i>festa</i>,” said Zrinyi eagerly. “The
peasants will be dancing all day. If you would go far
enough you would see them in their native costumes—impossible
near Budapest; but if you would deign to go
five hours on the train—to a village on one of my estates—”</p>

<p>“Deign!” whispered Alexandra.</p>

<p>The Archduchess turned to her Obersthofmeisterin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
with a very pretty show of deference. “I should like it,”
she said. “And I believe it is the right thing to do. I
could go very simply dressed; they have not yet seen
me; I should be under no restraint—what do you think,
<i>ma princesse</i>?”</p>

<p>“I shall have to go too,” grumbled Sarolta. “And
there must be no publicity about it. We must not get
the reputation here in Budapest for eccentricities;
neither must we ever explain ourselves—how early can
we leave here in the morning?”</p>

<p>“At five?” said Zrinyi.</p>

<p>“And we can return late—the palace can be lighted up
at seven as usual. I like the idea of seeing the Chardash
properly danced once more—so be it, then. Mind you
are at the station before us, Géra, and that you exert all
your talents in carrying out the programme. We shall
dine with you, of course.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” said Alexandra.</p>

<p>“<i>Élyen!</i>” murmured Zrinyi.</p>

<p>Ranata for a moment said nothing. Then with a
sudden impulse for which she could give no reason then
or later, she turned to Alexandra and said, “Where is
your brother? Have you heard from him?”</p>

<p>“Not a word since I asked him to come here. He had
probably started on his wanderings before my letter
reached Berlin. He may be on the Russian steppes or
over in Pest. The one is as likely as the other.”</p>

<p>Fessenden drew his leg over his horse’s neck and
looked idly about him. The sun was directly overhead;
he had forgotten his compass, and, apparently, he was lost
in the very middle of the great plain of Hungary. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
he had been lost many times before, and in far worse
places than this green and smiling expanse; so flat and
lying in an atmosphere of such clarity he could well believe
the gentle Magyar boast that with the naked eye a
man could be distinguished from a beast at a distance
of fifteen miles. There appeared to be nothing whatever
on the horizon; but an occasional small farm dotted
the prairie, and here and there he saw a goose girl with
her little flock, a shepherd in his native costume: a long
white coat of spun wool, with panels of black embroidered
at the edges; a garment as immaculate as if just
from the loom, and swung carelessly about the shoulders,
the sleeves evidently designed for ornament alone. The
little goose girls might have stood for a study in lonely
childhood; as Fessenden turned his head one was the
solitary figure in the vast expanse behind him; but when
he passed her she had nodded brightly and seemed
quite content with her lot. It was not his first visit to
Hungary; he had voyaged on the Danube and the Theiss
in his canoe, and had climbed Retyezat to the lake of
Zenoga, making his way thence into Roumania. He
knew something of the language and much of the hospitality
of the amiable peasant people, and could recall
no other country in whose wilderness he would rather
be lost. Moreover, the great plains of Hungary reminded
him of the wild reaches of his own country.
They were green and smiling, indescribably friendly and
gentle of aspect, in spite of the barbarous hordes, the
fierce battles that had ravaged them, the blood that had
soaked their soil; and the American deserts, without history
of consequence, scowled eternally at the sun that
devoured them, and gave no hospitality to man. But
both represented Nature in one of her abrupt desires to
emulate the plains of Space; both gave man a sense of
personal freedom, of disseverance from the complications<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
of life. And the great Alfold had long since suggested
to the practical mind of Fessenden what could
be done with the Western deserts; in the last five years
he had reclaimed the largest of them by means of a
complicated system of irrigation, and encouragement
of immigration from the Eastern States. One of his
dreams was to make the United States fertile and productive
from end to end, if only to relieve the congestion
in the great centres and give the plain people of his country
the happiness they constantly, with reason or without,
demanded as their birthright. But he had sighed
humorously more than once as he reflected that to compass
all his plans would require at least two more lifetimes
than Nature had placed at the disposal of any
man.</p>

<p>But he had accomplished a great deal, and he was
only thirty-one. Thirty years more, and did his energies
survive devastating tropical fevers, the rarely relaxing
strain of organizing and guarding industries, investments,
transit systems, the ever-trembling aggregations
of capital called Trusts, sound a money basis as his own
were built upon, all the manifold ramifications of a
fortune, which, through the increased resources of the
country during the past ten years, through his own and
his father’s genius, and by the mere force of momentum,
was now close upon a billion dollars; still far in the lead
of all the other colossal fortunes which in the past decade
had raised the United States to a position no less
menacing to herself than to the rest of the world;
did not only his health, his life, survive the strain,
but his ambition, his hope, his faith in the worth
while, then might he expect something like immortal
fame.</p>

<p>Most men would have said that he had fame and
power enough to satisfy any man of his years. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
accomplishment in South America alone had made his
name a byword on two hemispheres. In company with
his college friend, Jeremiah Keene, who promptly renounced
the Northwest, he had gone to South America,
intent upon fencing it off from European invasion and
saving his country from what he believed must otherwise
be an inevitable and humiliating war. Privately,
he thought the Monroe Doctrine an obsolete absurdity,
and heartily wished it never had been conceived. Like
all of his countrymen who thought, he would infinitely
have preferred the civilizing forces of Europe in South
America to the tumultuous opera-bouffe republics of
vicious hybrids, where no American could invest his
money with a reasonable certainty of seeing the tail of
it a year hence; but the Monroe Doctrine was as sacred
to the American people as the Lord’s Prayer, therefore
the only thing to do was to make it theirs in fact as well
as in fancy, and such an accomplishment must be the
work of one man, of a citizen of the United States,
who possessed that hitherto unheard-of combination
of boundless wealth and burning patriotism. The government
would never give a serious thought to the matter
until the fleets of Europe were in the Caribbean
Sea.</p>

<p>The three years in South America Fessenden looked
back upon as the most picturesque and satisfying of his
life. He had twice nearly died of fever, and he had been
stabbed and shot, but life had been adventurous, exciting,
never worth a moment’s purchase; above all, one
long test of his gifts and resources, with victory in the
end. Where immediate bribery had availed not with
the suspicious villain in temporary power, he had tracked
the biding rival to his lair, furnished him with the
necessary outfit and promises, while Keene and other
agents persuaded the ever-disaffected people that another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
revolution was due. With the impromptu gunboats
and inexhaustible ammunition sent down by Mr.
Abbott, the revolution was an invariable success, and
the enthroned dictator, with all the vices of his kind,
was still shrewd enough to comprehend that did he
wish his reign to be permanent he must be true to his
benefactor and give him a free hand.</p>

<p>As a state passed into Fessenden’s control he built a
railroad close to the coast, and as he employed native
labor as much as possible, and there was a rapid influx
of American merchants, he was reverenced as the White
God who had brought security and prosperity to a tormented
country.</p>

<p>With the more advanced states it was a mere question
of capital, particularly as the enterprise was a private
one, and sure to bring an increase of civilization and
wealth. The last tie had been laid seven years ago, and
South America girdled by a complete system of railways,
with at least one train on each section running daily.
To-day the trains had increased ten per cent., many
thousands of discontented North Americans had emigrated,
there were American school-houses, churches,
villages, and towns in every state, and a new and enormously
profitable investment had been found for American
capital. Four hundred thousand negroes had emigrated,
and, reverting easily to a state of amiable and
naked barbarism—sinking to the bottom as naturally
as the black mud of the Mississippi—worked in the fields
for the white man and forgot the Constitution of the
United States. Fessenden’s praises had been sung until
he might have become conceited and obnoxious had it
not been for the hostile press, which called him a robber
baron, an unscrupulous blood-letter, and a future Czar;
and so preserved the balance.</p>

<p>Then had come the long years at home, varied only by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
the yearly tramp in Europe and an occasional visit to
South America, where Keene was his general representative,
and his boyhood chum, Jeff Hunter, his scout and
secret agent. Two-thirds of the control of affairs had
gradually passed into his hands, but he had found time
to carry out his father’s more personal programme as
well as his own: the great army of working-men in his
employ believed in him blindly, and withstood the pressure
of trades-unions. He had, indeed, raised the standard
of wages throughout the United States, and had
made so many bitter enemies that much of his best
talent was consumed in circumventing the attempts of
other great capitalists to ruin him. With the decent
laboring man he was more popular than any President
of the United States could hope to be; and this class was
not only grateful for his actual benefits, and appreciated
his sincerity, but believed that he had been as especially
created to pilot the United States through her difficulties
as the great men of the early days of the republic.
His methods and his genius were different, but so were
the times. With the professional politician of the laboring
class, with that breed who made their bread and beer
by agitating, he was deservedly unpopular, but he now
had most of them in his pocket, and they gave him little
trouble. He hoped to bring about a condition of living
in the United States which would avert a death struggle
between capital and labor; if this task were beyond him,
then would he at least be in a position in some measure
to control it.</p>

<p>When the war broke out with Spain it was a matter of
deep mortification and disappointment to him that the
great electrical and mechanical ideal he had conceived
in his youth was so far from completion. It had, indeed,
given him more trouble than all his other enterprises
together. Three accomplished electricians had met<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
with violent deaths in the building on the prairie, and he
had their discontented families on his hands. Two reporters
had been maimed for life while attempting to
solve a mystery which annoyed the public, accustomed
to the easy elucidations of the press, and others had
“lost their jobs” for failure as signal, if less painful. All
these men were among Fessenden’s bitterest and most
enterprising foes.</p>

<p>Again and again, when his keenest attention was demanded
in New York, he had received an excited telegram
bidding him hasten to the spot and witness the
final combination which was to affect the great result;
and as invariably he had added to the sum of his disappointments.
Five years ago the buildings, in the
course of a wind-storm, had burned to the ground, and
not only the difficult and expensive machinery had gone
with them, but the personal effects of several hundred
men. More than once Fessenden’s faith had been
shaken, and even with the vast resources at his disposal
he had hesitated before the increasing costliness of his
coy ideal; but he dreaded the possibly demoralizing
effect of his first failure; the position in which he
could place the United States lured him on; and his
father believed in the idea and encouraged him to persist.
When the war threatened, Fessenden went out to
his Western settlement and worked in the laboratory
and machine-shops himself. At the last possible moment
he hastened home and raised one of the most satisfactory
regiments that went to Cuba. By this time
he was a rigid disciplinarian, and his original genius for
detail was fully developed. He also found his opportunity
to distinguish himself, and returned to New York
better pleased with life than since he had left South
America.</p>

<p>And the old Fessenden? There was much of him left,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
for strong individualities with the eternal boy in them
change less than psychologists would have us believe,
however much they may develop. He was less enthusiastic
about some of his old ideals; his patience was at the
same time greater and less; he was even more practical
than Nature had made him, matter-of-fact and intolerant
of shams, and somewhat hardened and cynical by
his constant manipulation of fabulous wealth and the
buying of men. Although money would never be his
god, his life and times had taught him to respect, almost
to reverence it as the mightiest force in the world of
his day. He had in his brief span watched the crumbling
of ancient aristocracies, the progressive ascendency
of the middle classes all over Europe, their reconstruction
of power in their various states, their contributions
to solidity and permanence, their slow absorption of the
helpless classes above, and their increasing contempt for
royal figure-heads; in his own country he had witnessed
an outburst of wealth that in volume and results had
never occurred before in the history of the world. He
saw the financial centre of gravity swinging steadily
from London to New York, the enormous aggregations
of capital, combined with the unlimited production of
the United States, controlling the markets of the world.
Money had raised the United States from a negligible
quantity, often mentioned with disrespect, into a menace
which was winning for her the precarious tributes
of hatred and abuse, more especially since she had let
it be seen that she estimated affectionate overtures at
their just value.</p>

<p>Therefore was her most characteristic product filled
with a quiet and gentle arrogance, sadly, if contemptuously,
confident of the illimitable powers of wealth, and
owning to a sincere respect for but one man in Europe.
With that man, in spite of a deep and mutual friendship,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
he played many a game of chess, and once in a while
he was beaten.</p>

<p>He no longer regarded the severe and ofttimes thunderous
visage of William of Germany with envy; for
time and work, fever and bitter anxieties had robbed
his own face of all its freshness and most of its youth.
His long body had lost its lankness, and was closely
knit, properly covered, and very erect and imposing;
but his face was thin, sallow, lined, and his finely
cut features had acquired the sharpness peculiar to the
American of intellect who gives his life to practical
affairs—the sort that has the mere million-making kink
is always as fat of face as of wit. But his smile was still
quick and delightful, and his eyes, if sharper, were as
bright and dark, sometimes as happy and eager as ever.
He had acquired the trick of throwing back his head,
lowering his upper lid, and darting a look over a cheek-bone,
which was merely impish, or peculiarly disconcerting,
according to his mood. As regards the rest of his
personal appearance on this October morning in Hungary,
he wore a sweater, the oldest pair of trousers in
his wardrobe, and a straw hat with the brim turned
down—by which it will be seen there was a good deal
of the old Fessenden left.</p>

<p>Indeed there was a great deal; and as he rode straight
towards the gala village on Count Zrinyi’s estate, he was
in a very susceptible not to say sentimental frame of
mind—which was usually the case when he was alone in
Europe. The fountain of romance in the depths of him
still bubbled. He had worked it deeply in the way of
adventure and the realizing of patriotic ideals, superficially
when he met an attractive woman. But life
had pressed him too hard for love; moreover, he was
easily disillusioned, and this particular ideal increased
in stature and seemed ever more impossible of attainment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
He stood on a lonely height himself, and he
wanted a woman who stood on one as lonely.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">XI</h3>
</div>

<p>Fessenden stood for a few moments at the window
before entering, although he had danced the Chardash
many times and was arrayed as one of the elect. The
deserted street of the village, and the muffled strains
of a gypsy band, had informed him as he approached
that it was a day of dancing and feasting, and he had
despatched a casual boy to summon the tallest young
man of the village. From the genial peasant he had
borrowed a native costume, and without the aid of gold—for
he carried a love potion in his indifferent command
of the Magyar tongue. Another New-Yorker
might have been daunted by the white divided skirt,
which looked like anything but trousers, and the white
blouse hanging free above it, but not Fessenden. He
would indeed have preferred the Sunday best which the
man had offered him to his own undoing, but had generously
refused it. The men all looked very fine in their
gay cloth or leathern jackets, embroidered, inlaid, their
bright sashes, loose shirts and flapping trousers, embroidered
with worsted or silk; but the women, after
decorating their lords and brothers, would appear to have
had no time left to enhance their own charms, for they
wore common cotton frocks and had made no attempt at
adornment beyond a ribbon or a string of glass beads.</p>

<p>The room in which they danced evidently belonged
to the rich man of the village. It was of fair size for a
peasant’s house, and its prints of saints and Mary were
draped with embroidered towels. The older folk sat
against the wall, and some sixty young people danced in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
what at first sight looked to be a solid mass. The Chardash
was near its finish, and the couples were executing
the vigorous and intricate figures, even separating for a
second and flying together again, without the collision of
an elbow or the twitch of a facial muscle.</p>

<p>Suddenly Fessenden swore in three languages and
clutched the arm of his host.</p>

<p>“Who is that girl?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“I do not know her name. The Count came two
hours ago with two—Austrian peasants,” he said, “but
we doubt—who wished to learn the Chardash. We
know nothing further, except that they speak Hungarian
well and are virgins, for they wear their braids
hanging; but we are curious, for that one you admire is
very pretty and lively, and the other is as beautiful and
queenlike as a Roumanian peasant—observe her, my
friend.”</p>

<p>The music had ceased and the crowd was melting
towards the open. The girl worthy to be compared to a
Roumanian stood almost in the middle of the room
talking with pleasing humility to a young man who,
even in his peasant’s costume, was plainly the lord of
the village. She wore a common blue cotton gown a
size too small for her, and a kerchief pinned so tightly
about her head that only half an inch of hair brushed
flatly backward was visible. But the figure was magnificent;
the hands were small, pointed, white; the skin of
face and throat had never been exposed to a peasant
sun, and the visible hair was red. The girl suddenly
raised her eyes, and Fessenden screwed up his own and
left the window.</p>

<p>So he had seen the Archduchess!—was about to meet
her at last! The fountain burst its bonds and flew to
his head. His deep, almost passionate love of adventure
shook him slightly from head to foot. The color<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
came into his face, and his nostrils quivered. If he could
only corner his sister and warn her before she betrayed
him by a feminine scream. She was standing just within
the door arranging the ribbon at the end of her long
plait of hair, which, like many another, had been disordered
by the energy of the dance; and the hanging
tresses brought forward for reconstruction by herself
and several other maidens may possibly have fetched a
sigh from lips too soon surrendered. Fessenden entered
and placed his back between her face and Ranata.</p>

<p>“Now don’t even raise your eyes,” he said rapidly. “I
want to be unknown here. I want you to introduce me
to her and not tell her who I am.”</p>

<p>Fessenden had underestimated his sister’s accomplishments.
“I won’t do anything of the sort,” she replied,
smoothing her kerchief with steady fingers. “It is just
one thing I should never dare to do. The responsibility
shall be entirely your own.”</p>

<p>“Very well. I can manage it if you do not betray
me. What on earth does this mean, anyhow? Are
you and she here alone? I don’t see the ghost of a
chaperon.”</p>

<p>“Our first idea was merely to look on, but we had no
sooner arrived at Count Zrinyi’s castle this morning than
Sarolta was attacked by the gout—or pretended she was;
she is an angel—and ordered us to our rooms. We made
Zrinyi borrow clothes from two of his servants—and
here we are. I’ve never had so much fun in my life—neither
has Ranata.” She looked him over. “You are
not a bad imitation,” she admitted. “So many of them
are fair, and luckily they all wear their hats. Pull your
brim a little lower; your eyes are hopelessly American.
Of course you’ll fall in love with her—I’ve seen it coming
for years; but don’t propose on the spot and spoil
all our fun.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>“What do you take me for?” and Fessenden left her
to an admiring peasant and sought his host.</p>

<p>“That girl is very pretty,” he said discontentedly,
“but I can’t dance with a girl so much shorter than myself;
I am always swinging her off her feet. Will you
introduce me to the other Austrian—or Roumanian, did
you say?”</p>

<p>“What is your name, my friend?”</p>

<p>“Árpád Hunyadi will do as well as any other.”</p>

<p>The peasant embraced him on both cheeks. “A great
name,” he said solemnly. “All I have is yours.”</p>

<p>A moment later Fessenden was standing before the
Archduchess, while Zrinyi’s willing eyes were diverted
by Alexandra.</p>

<p>“You will dance this with me?” he asked in Magyar,
his eyes bashfully lowered.</p>

<p>“You are not a Hungarian!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Alas, that your first word should be so cruel! It is
true that I speak the German tongue better—I have
been much away—but my children shall speak only
Hungarian.”</p>

<p>“It is to be hoped so.”</p>

<p>“You will dance with me?”</p>

<p>“I do not know. I am tired.”</p>

<p>“One is never too tired for the Chardash. It would
raise a Hungarian from the grave.” This was uttered
with simple fervor. He felt her powerful gaze and
dared not raise his eyes. But the majestic beauty of
her figure was in the direct line of his vision, and involuntarily
he lifted his hands to tuck in his shirt, but bethought
himself in time.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” repeated the Archduchess coldly,
“I am tired, and I do not happen to be a Hungarian.”</p>

<p>“A Roumanian? We have all said it; you are so
beautiful.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>“No.”</p>

<p>The leader of the gypsy band struck his cymbal. His
brothers drew the first long wail from their fiddles. The
crowd thronged in.</p>

<p>Fessenden raised his hands and placed them firmly
about the slender waist of the Archduchess. “Put your
hands on my shoulders,” he said. “I shall not let you
go.”</p>

<p>She drew herself up rigidly for a moment, then obeyed
him.</p>

<p>“I know who you are,” she said.</p>

<p>“So much the better,” replied Fessenden.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“This is a great moment in the history of Hungary!”
said Zrinyi solemnly.</p>

<p>“It is!” said Alexandra.</p>

<p>“A daughter of the Emperor of Austria and a Hungarian
peasant! What a symbol! It is full of portent!”</p>

<p>“If you only knew how much!”</p>

<p>“Ah, you dream of a universal democracy, I suppose.
I fear I dream only of the independence of Hungary—with
William as enlightened overlord—and the humiliation
of Austria.”</p>

<p>“I can’t talk politics and dance the Chardash.”</p>

<p>Fessenden summoned to his eyes a far and impassive
stare. Ranata pointed her lashes to her cheeks. They
were the tallest couple in the room, and those who sat
had much to say in comment. There was little to criticise,
for their natural grace and beauty of form diverted
the eye from their few mistakes; and in truth those
whose blood is quick must learn the Chardash easily. For
a time the music is a wail of almost hopeless longing, and
the feet and body move hesitatingly, monotonously, the
man and woman at arm’s-length; gradually it grows
sweeter, more inspiring, and the feet move faster—life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
seems to awaken. The music swells and the man takes
the girl’s left hand and raises it high; then, as it becomes
triumphant and peremptory, he swings her faster and
faster, executes wild and rapid figures, stamps his feet,
snaps his fingers in the air, increases his speed to that of
the whirlwind, flings his partner from him and catches
her again, to whirl and whirl and whirl in a circle scarcely
larger than his feet; and all without a moment of forgetfulness,
a rude embrace, a change of expression. “It
is the story of elementary passion before man was
created to express it,” Ranata had said to Alexandra
before they had ventured to take part; and certainly the
Hungarian peasant, intelligent and gay, but polite and
dignified to his marrow, is worthy of a place beside the
impersonal artists of any civilization.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the Chardash is so intoxicating that no
one can dance it perfunctorily, no matter how self-conscious
at starting; and there was nothing here to distract
the attention of the most fastidious: the air was pure,
for the windows were open, and the Hungarian peasant
is clean. No matter what the pressure of the speed, not
a foot was trodden, not a temper shaken. Fessenden
had danced half the native dances of the world, sometimes
in hours of greater abandon than this, and Ranata had
a natural love of the dance and indulged it whenever possible.
As she had recognized and intuitively obeyed
her friend’s brother, she realized in a flash that for sixteen
years he had occupied a silent but permanent place
in a shadowy realm that was hers alone. He had been
Alexandra’s favorite theme from childhood, and Ranata’s
interest had never flagged. His sister was as
truthful as most women, but in her extreme youth she
had possessed a violent imagination, and her unknown
brother, dwelling in the wilderness, had inspired it to
deeds which had caused the little Archduchess to sit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
open-mouthed for hours as she drank in his blood-curdling
and heroic adventures with Indian tribes, robber
bands, pirates, and wild beasts of every variety whose
pictures were to be found in Alexandra’s natural history.
He had seemed to her the most splendid and
picturesque of living creatures, and although the reduction
of Alexandra’s allowance for a year to the wages
of a footman by her perturbed father had cured her of
the habit of exaggeration, she still could tell a pretty
tale, and there had been much to recount during Fessenden’s
sojourn in South America and after his return.
To a princess living the most conventional and restricted
of earthly lives he represented all that the world, beyond
palace walls, held of romance, of freedom, of the
grand free play of personality. As she grew older she
forbade her fancy to lead him into the backwaters of
sentiment, that being a part of the necessary discipline
of self; but there had been times when the effort had
exhausted her. Two thoughts had flashed through her
mind as she realized that she stood face to face with
him at last: the one came from depths she did not
pause to analyze—“If I had suddenly heard that he
was dead, instead of meeting him like this, I should have
been appalled by a sense of personal loss.” The other
thought flew straight from superstition and made her
for the moment the sister of the peasant-women about
her—“This colored frock! I might have known it
would bring me bad luck!”</p>

<p>In a moment she had angrily dismissed both suggestions,
but she endeavored to nurse a general resentment.
She had been taken abominable advantage of. He had
known who she was and dared to treat her like any ordinary
girl masquerading. That royalty, or aristocracy
for that matter, moves on unselfconscious heights is one
of the fictions of fiction. The aristocracies of Europe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
may not, in the manner of the American, carry their
ancestors like a bunch of chips on their shoulder, but
like royalty, they are “simple and unaffected” only so
long as they are not expected to be humble and are not
approached by the wrong sort of people. The intense
dramatic moments of William of Germany might alone
convince the unthinking of royalty’s sense of its own
value.</p>

<p>Ranata was not dramatic, or at all events had wanted
opportunity; but had she inherited the simplicity of her
mother, which assuredly she had not, she would have
found it a difficult task to forget that she was the daughter
of an emperor. But she had experienced no such
inclination. She might sigh for liberty, and in erratic
moments wish she had been born an American, but to
her composition had gone the haughtiest particles of
Europe. She was not only the last born of an ancient
line of kings who had exercised despotic rule over vast
possessions, but who had built about themselves a triple
golden wall of ceremony. No court had ever been so
uncomplaisant, no royal favor so difficult to gain; to-day
no house in Europe was so tenacious of its ancient
formalities. Every act of Ranata’s life to which the
least importance could be attached had been the combined
result of her active consciousness that she was the
daughter of the Emperor of Austria, and of instinctive
ancestral tribute.</p>

<p>Therefore did the Archduchess Ranata Theresia feel
that her sacred self had been trifled with, and was filled
with wrath against her friend and her friend’s brother.
But it is both difficult and anomalous to nurse the
severer passions while moving one’s body and feet to
the cry of the Chardash for the fulfilment of human happiness.
A mist rose to and diffused itself through the
historic tiers of Ranata’s brain, and created an illusion.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
The music of the Chardash, older than the House of
Hapsburg, as old, perhaps, as that mysterious gypsy people
who brought it to Hungary, was the song of the
wind among peaks about a wild and lovely valley high
in the Eastern Alps. She was primeval woman dancing
with primeval man. A silver hammer rang on the
distant rocks, the wind drew its bow on the young
branches of the trees; all the new world moved in measure
about her, groping towards its birthright. The
vague melancholy promise of Nature grew ever more
distinct in its utterance, swelled in fuller volume from
the heights and passes. The man felt it and swung her
with swifter assurance, clasped her surrendered waist
more firmly; then in the wild and breathless whirl,
where the male, inspired by the reckless adhortation of
the music, expresses the insolent triumph of his manhood,
and the woman alone hears the persistent note
of sadness, the warning of the unfulfilment of mortal
desire, the heroine of this tale was the creature of another
will. In that dizzying circle she followed his
every motion, the peremptory guiding of his hand, with
neither thought nor desire of resistance; and when he
flung her scornfully from him she leaped back to his
embrace as automatically as the meanest peasant in the
room. At the end she was conscious of nothing but
that the mountain-tops were flying about her in a furious
attempt to meet and crash together; the shouting
of the men, the abrupt loud stamping of their feet, as the
musicians played like madmen, came to her confused
senses as the forces of the earth bursting their bonds;
and when the illusion abruptly finished and she found
herself on the veranda she leaned heavily against the
wall and sought for nothing but her breath.</p>

<p>Fessenden mopped his streaming face. “By Jove!”
he remarked, “that was warm work! But it’s a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
dance—and you—you—were simply magnificent! When
I get my breath I’ll tell you how grateful I am.”</p>

<p>Ranata lifted her head and assumed an expression of
frigid severity, which shone oddly from a face that was
wet and red from hair to throat.</p>

<p>“Would you like to walk up and down the road for a
change?” asked Fessenden.</p>

<p>“No!” exclaimed Ranata, still short of breath. “I
should not.”</p>

<p>“You are not ready for another?”</p>

<p>“No, I am not ready for another!” She spoke with
an asperity quite unnatural in a princess who never forgot
to be gracious, lest she wound the <i>amour propre</i> of
those at her mercy. The tumult within her had soured
and fermented into a sudden hatred of the colossal
wealth, the constant exercise of a power greater than
her father’s, and the habit of republican independence,
which enabled this man to stand before her as unconcernedly
as if she were a girl of his own class. Her
wrath might be unreasonable, but she was in no mood
to admit it, and she was divided between a desire to
relieve her tension with tears and for power to humiliate
the man.</p>

<p>Fessenden, who was too hot and thirsty to be sentimental,
much less conscious of outraged royalty that
he had been swinging in the Chardash, glanced about
longingly. “I think there must be wine in that shed,”
he said. “Where there is a crowd after the Chardash
there usually is wine; and doubtless the Count has set
up a barrel of his own. If you will wait here I’ll fetch
you some.”</p>

<p>As he walked away, his white blouse and skirts flapping
in the breeze, Ranata sank upon a bench. For the
first time in her life she was nonplussed, at a loss what
to do. Her long experience with Alexandra did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
help her in the least. Not only had she always regarded
the American girl as <i>sui generis</i>, but it had been her
royal pleasure that she should be so. She suddenly became
aware that her friend was standing before her.</p>

<p>“Of course you are angry,” said Miss Abbott contritely.
“And I must confess at once that I knew he
was here, and might have warned you. But Fessenden
is Fessenden, and I knew that he would do what he
wanted in spite of me or any one else. Would you
rather go at once?”</p>

<p>The Archduchess rose with alacrity. “Yes,” she said,
“let us go as quickly as possible.”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">XII</h3>
</div>

<p>Fessenden sat over his coffee on the terrace of his
hotel in Pest, and stared up at Buda with little appreciation
of its evening beauty. The sunset glow still lingered,
pushing forward the dark masses of the Schwabenberg,
where brilliant points of light were appearing
among the dim outlines of the villas. On the long
ridge above the Danube, and the abrupt irregular heights
beyond, lights were darting forth rapidly, and one wing
of the palace was illuminated. The irregular groups and
single dots of fire gave the fissures and cliffs, the ruins
of the citadel on its isolated height far to the left, and
the beautiful outline of the palace a dark and savage
grandeur. On the rough side of the cliff, far below the
citadel, was a mass of lights like a meteor fallen upon a
void, so dark were the woods and rocks about the little
kiosk where men and women drank their iced coffee to
the music of the gypsies. Along the ridge on the right
of the palace were the melting outlines of public buildings,
of ancient churches, the arches of the chapel above<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
the dust of Shêkl Gül Baba, which alone commemorates
the century and a half of Turkish occupation, and the
modern structures which cover the baths the Romans
built two thousand years ago. Down on the riverbank,
in the shadow of the precipitous gardens of the
palace, the cafés were brilliantly alight, and the music
of cymbal and fiddle floated over to Pest and mingled
with the strains of the gypsy band in the hotel behind
Fessenden.</p>

<p>On the long line of terrace before the hotels of Pest,
hundreds sat at little tables smoking and drinking their
coffee. On the wide promenade in front many more
sauntered, the women gayly and fashionably dressed,
many of them beautiful, animated—bewitching, no
doubt, to the fine-looking men who accompanied them.
Fessenden had a fervent admiration for the women of
Hungary, and he had sat at this same table during
former visits and observed them with pleasure. But
to-night his eyes rarely wandered from the balcony at
the southeast extremity of the palace, where several
figures were discernible, and the regular rising, lingering,
disappearing of what might have been the travail
of a miniature volcano. The volcano, doubtless, was
the Princess Sarolta of Windischgrätz, for the figures
had moved from time to time, and there appeared to be
no man among them. Once the tallest of the group
had entered the room at the corner and stood for a moment
against the light. Fessenden, his heart beating
faster, had fancied he recognized the Archduchess, and
had half risen in angry determination to cross the river
and storm the hill, but had thrown himself back in his
chair and ordered another glass of iced coffee.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, his anger did not cool nor his determination
weaken. It was now three days since he and Ranata
had surrendered themselves to the wild exhilaration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
of the Chardash, and he had not even received permission
to call on his sister in the palace. Alexandra
had written him that the Archduchess was doubtless
very angry, as she had ignored the day in the village as
completely as if her memory had failed her, and every
one was in doubt as to the manner in which they were
to dance the Chardash at the ball. “But the ball will
take place,” Miss Abbott had added, “and if you will
possess your soul in patience and remain here, I shall
make a very especial point of your coming. She can
hardly refuse. Indeed, she would know that if she did
it would be the end of our friendship. I refuse to look
ahead in this matter. I have always known that something
would happen when you met. It is all on the
knees of the gods. The twentieth century is not the
eighteenth nor yet the nineteenth. For my part, I
want to see history make itself, and the past, I hold, is
merely designed by the inexorable law of progress as a
background for the present. There will be an American
queen in Europe yet. I am glad I am young—and I
love you both.”</p>

<p>She had asked Zrinyi and Prince Illehazy to call upon
him, and he had pressed a tailor into hasty service and
dined with them at the Park Club on successive evenings.
He knew that he must meet the Archduchess before
long, for both these nobles had designed entertainments
in her honor, nor was it likely that she would refuse his
sister’s request. But he was not possessing his soul in
patience. He was used to personal activity in the
levelling of obstacles; moreover, the resentment of the
Archduchess seemed to him the most erratic manifestation
of feminine perversity to which man had ever been
subjected. If she choose to dress herself as a peasant
and dance with peasants, what right had she to vent her
anger upon him for dancing with her as respectfully as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
the most courteous among them? He had chosen to
ignore her state, and no course could have been more consistent.
He would not apologize, for he had done nothing
culpable; he was as entitled to incognito as herself.
To vent her wrath on him for a situation of her own
making was a caprice so far unworthy of her character,
as he understood it, that he was inclined to believe there
was a misapprehension of which he knew nothing. By
which it will be seen that there were many things Fessenden
knew better than woman.</p>

<p>Whether he was in love with the Archduchess of Austria
or not he was at no pains to discover. But his instinct
for adventure was now on edge—the youth in him
was rampant; New York was non-existent; his weeks of
rest in Europe, passed almost entirely in solitude and
sunshine, had made his pulses full and quick; he was
ready for anything, and his will had never set itself
more squarely. Here were all the high elements of
romance at last; moreover, when he awakened in the
night and heard the distant wail or rush of the Chardash,
he trembled and experienced a sensation of
being stabbed by something that was both sharp and
sweet.</p>

<p>The attitude of the Archduchess, the insurmountable
barrier she had raised, but whetted his determination to
know her. With all his contempt for monarchy, he
was still too wise in its ways to make the mistake of
republican approach. He was unconventional, but he
was also a man of the world; while he would not hesitate
to insist upon talking with any sovereign as man to man,
with no more formality than he would yield to the
President of the United States, he knew that to walk up
to a palace door and demand admittance, even to his
sister’s apartments, would be merely to make an ass of
himself. Moreover, he had long since learned that one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
of the secrets of man’s victory over life is never to court
certain failure.</p>

<p>The afternoon before, he had crossed over to Buda
and walked all round the palace. The great gates on
the Danube looked impervious to battering-rams. On
the farther side of the court-yard the central portion of
the palace, which was of a symmetrical height in front,
was built straight down to the street behind in no less
than eighteen tiers of rooms. There were guards everywhere,
and it looked as impregnable as a fortress. The
gardens surrounded the front and south of the palace.
At the north end were more guards, and just without
the great court-yard, easy of access at its northern extremity,
its southern gates closed upon the private gardens,
was the guard-house. Connecting the vast front
of the palace with the mass at the rear of the court-yard
were galleries and many rooms. The private apartments
of the royal family did not look upon the court,
but were in the extension beyond it, above that sacred
portion of the grounds to which the public was never
admitted. No princess had ever been more securely
intrenched. The wild idea of disguising himself as a
working-man, and obtaining entrance to the portion of
the palace as yet unfinished within, had invaded Fessenden’s
brain and been dismissed. In that huge labyrinth
a man would be lost and found many times before he
was escorted to the guard-house.</p>

<p>Fessenden, who liked a good story, had read the romances
of the day which dealt with the imaginary modern
princess of the imaginary modern kingdom, thrilling
scenes of rescue, hair-breadth escapes, revolutions.
They had been in his mind as he whimsically examined
the palace, but they were no guide for him, even had he
been of a less practical turn of mind. Were there a
revolution in Budapest, none would be safer than the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
Archduchess. There would be no hair-breadth rescue
from that palace, unless, indeed, of himself. There was
no moat, no drawbridge. The walls were ever visible
to more than guards. He would meet her at balls, at
dinners; a word alone with her in the garden or a corner
of a balcony would seem to be all that he might anticipate.
Nevertheless, the situation was romantic enough
to keep him in Budapest; nor, he suspected, was Ranata
a woman who needed romantic accessories; she
would doubtless have interested him similarly in his
father’s house in New York. She was evidently a
creature of many sides, an infinite number of ingredients
mixed into a not altogether harmonious whole.
As Fessenden caught himself sentimentally wondering
if she were the isolated being of whom he had dreamed,
and who like himself lacked completeness, he remembered
that he had promised Zrinyi a game of Csendes—the
Hungarian poker—at ten o’clock; but as he strolled
up to the Nemzesi Casino he vowed anew that he would
know the daughter of the Emperor of Austria and King
of Hungary if he had to run the gamut of all the conventions.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">XIII</h3>
</div>

<p>It was on the following morning that the Archduchess
remarked to Miss Abbott—they were walking on the
third terrace and paused under the shade of a heavy
tree—“I have decided that the bodice of my costume
shall be of blue velvet instead of black—and the
train.”</p>

<p>Alexandra being too dumfounded to reply, Ranata
continued, “I have concluded that superstitions are
unworthy of any one who claims to live by the light of
his reason. Therefore I have made up my mind deliberately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
to violate all that may still linger like weeds in
my mind.”</p>

<p>“Blue is very becoming to you.”</p>

<p>“I think more so than any other color except perhaps
green. I have also ordered several green gowns. I shall
not interfere with your pinks and yellows.”</p>

<p>“That is kind, my dear, for you certainly would extinguish
me. I see your new rôle is to lack nothing in
thoroughness. Have you made up your mind how the
Chardash is to be danced?”</p>

<p>“As it should be danced. Why not? All the manifestations
are on the part of the men; the women do little
but keep time.”</p>

<p>The moment was favorable, the ice of Ranata’s three
days’ reserve being broken, but Alexandra hesitated to
introduce the subject of Fessenden. When Ranata
chose to be unfathomable there was an aloofness about
her which suggested that her soul was surrounded by
the watchful ghosts of all her ancestors. She had never
looked more aloof than to-day, despite the apparent
frivolity of her conversation. She was standing very
straight, apparently absorbed in contemplation of the
roofs of Pest, glittering in fragments through the leaves
of Buda. In the deep shade of the tree her face looked
like marble, her hair like metal. There had been no
coolness between the girls since the day of the <i>festa</i>.
They had been much together and talked on any other
subject; but it had been evident to Alexandra that a
part of the Archduchess’s mind had been bent introspectively,
and she had retired to her bedroom earlier
and left it later than was her habit. How Fessenden
had impressed her, what tortuous train of thought she
had been following, Alexandra felt it would be folly to
guess, for she knew there were depths and ways in that
mind no friend would ever enter. But it was her policy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
never to manifest surprise, except at some lighter erraticism,
and she did not lift an eyebrow when Ranata
turned to her and said sweetly:</p>

<p>“Do you think your brother would dine with us to-night?
We were to have been forty, but Sarolta tells
me that Count Ábris Teleky is ill.”</p>

<p>“I am sure Fessenden would be delighted.”</p>

<p>“Will you write, or shall Sarolta send him a formal
invitation?”</p>

<p>“I will write. Perhaps I had better go at once.”</p>

<p>“I will wait for you here.”</p>

<p>“How did she know he is in Pest?” wondered Miss
Abbott, as she ran up the steps in the terrace wall.
“And <i>what</i> is she up to?”</p>

<p>When she returned, Ranata was sitting on the rustic
bench staring at the ground. Alexandra sat down beside
her.</p>

<p>“What do you think of Count Zrinyi’s invitation
to visit his castle in the Transylvanian Alps?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“I should like to go. Retyezat was the scene of
Rudolf’s first visit to Transylvania—he was the guest of
Count Samuel Teleky who took him to Boldogfalva, the
castle of Baron Kendeffy—it is not far from Zrinyi’s
castle—and they went into camp on Lake Zenoga.
That was one of the most delightful experiences of Rudolf’s
life! He hunted the bear all over those frozen
peaks, high above any vegetation except the Alpine
roses. He used to thrill me with his descriptions of
those terrible rugged mountains, the breathless wait for
the bear, sometimes terrified, as often stolidly unsuspecting,
and then the wild dance of the Wallach and
Roumanian beaters round the camp-fire at night to the
music of their flutes. Rudolf and all the others of the
party sat huddled under a rock, muffled in furs, smoking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
the long Hungarian pipe; but the wild men of the mountains
were warm enough, for they danced like fiends, and
the effect of the wild gyrations almost in the very midst
of the leaping flames, the great teeth of the rocks cutting
the sky on every side, the gathering storm shrieking into
the sweet wild music of the flutes, the infernal cries of
the excited creatures—I remember Rudolf swept all the
things off my most precious table in his animation the
first time he told me the story! Those were his happiest
days—his hunting expeditions to Transylvania for
bear and other game, and he loved to talk to me about
them, for no one else cared to listen—at home, at least.
Even when I was a child he often came and spent an
hour with me, partly out of pity for my loneliness, partly
because I was so much like himself in many ways, and in
despair that I could not join in all his sports. He promised
me the last time he returned from Transylvania that
the next year I should go with him to Görgény—the
crown property where he always went after that first
visit. The occasion upon which he won his oak as a
Transylvanian bear-hunter was almost as exciting in another
way. When he had killed his first bear the beaters
tied its legs together, and raising it on crossed poles
carried it through the forest to the stretchers, followed
by all the Roumanians in their strange costumes shouting
<i>Setreasca! Setreasca!</i> The guests surrounding Rudolf
responded with <i>Élyens</i> almost as wild, and Count
Teleky dipped an oak twig in the bear’s blood and presented
it to Rudolf, who stuck it in his cap. When he
returned to the castle in the evening, all the delighted
and shouting people knew by that sign that their prince
had taken his position among the great bear-hunters of
Transylvania.”</p>

<p>Ranata had been speaking rapidly and excitedly. As
she finished she sprang to her feet. The blood was in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
her cheeks, and her eyes were flashing with a curious
angry animation.</p>

<p>“Do you think any man could ever come between me
and the memory of my brother?” she demanded passionately—“between
my duty to his memory, to his unfinished
work? Do you think that I could ever admire, love,
respect any man one-half so well? What of his weaknesses?
He had the greatest of natures. He knew that
he had the fate of Europe in his hands, and he would
have made the soberest of rulers. Do you think that
any woman was ever so fortified as I against the common
weakness of woman? Rudolf!—Austria!—” She turned
abruptly and walked down the dim path under the wall.</p>

<p>Alexandra caught her breath. She felt curiously uncomfortable,
as a sensitive American girl, unskilled in
feeling, always does at the sudden revelation of passion
in another woman. Calmly to analyze the passions of
the world, and stare ironically at the complications of
life through a lorgnette, was all in the mental progress
of a girl brought up with the peculiar advantages of
Alexandra and possessing her uncommon acuteness;
but direct contact vaguely offended the cool purity of
her lighter nature.</p>

<p>She also experienced a sensation of terror which vibrated
oddly among her calm and calculating particles.
Should she write and tell Fessenden to go at once? Or—might
it not be merely Ranata’s imagination that
had taken fire? Impossible that she could love a man
with whom she had not exchanged ten words; who to
his sister’s critical eye had looked like anything but a
god with his shirt hanging over his skirts, and sweating
like any crimson peasant in the room—she had sent
Zrinyi out immediately to wash his face. No, she decided,
after a few moments of hard maidenly thinking,
it was merely the romantic streak in that abundant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
dreaming nature that had claimed dominion for the
moment—aggravated no doubt by much retrospection
and idealizing since; the occasion and Fessenden, to
Alexandra’s mind, stood in need of at least three days’
perspective and created glamour. But should she send
away Fessenden and leave Ranata at peace with her
dead and her duties? She hardly had realized what
she expected to result upon the meeting of these two.
A vague and picturesque drama, mixed with much history,
with a final prophetic vision of the two in New
York, had whirled through her head. Passion, suffering,
tragedy—she had given them no thought, well as
she knew Ranata’s capacity for all. Her friend had
been the heroine of many romances woven by her energetic
brain; but the romances had been creations of
an exalted and poetic nature, like unto what she assumed
the gods and goddesses had compassed.</p>

<p>And Fessenden? How would he fall in love? He
usually teased her and joked with her; but his serious
side and his achievement had no more fervent admirer.
He had never told her an anecdote in which a woman
figured sentimentally; to what degree women had the
power to move him she found herself unable to imagine.
He certainly was adventurous—born to make and to
change history; therefore had she coupled him with
Ranata in some great drama of the future; but in looks
and deportment he was as little romantic as any other
American. She calculated rapidly that he had upset
most of her theories about him at least once a year
since she had known him, and recalled that she had frequently
wondered how well she ever should know him.
She half rose. Should she send him away? She sank
back with a laugh. That was beyond the power of anything
short of law or violence. She recalled the angry
and determined letter she had received the day before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>“He will come!” she thought. “They will meet and
talk. Well—it is all on the knees of the gods.”</p>

<p>Ranata returned and sat beside her. “We were talking
about visiting your count,” she said. “I am sure
you want to go, and it will give me the opportunity to
make the progress I intended through some of the villages.
But it will have to be a little later. I must start
the ball here first—make as deep an impression as possible
before leaving Budapest even for a week. Why
do you not ask your brother to take tea with you to-day?
I shall be engaged this afternoon, but you will
enjoy having him to yourself. Forgive me that I did
not think of it before, but my mind has been so full of
other things—the best plan of campaign with the members
of the Left, for one. And tell him of all our plans
and schemes. I should be glad of the advice of one so
accustomed to the management of men.”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">XIV</h3>
</div>

<p>The Princess Sarolta, apparently absorbed in the
achievements of the chef of Királyi Palota and the lively
conversation about her, observed her imperial charge
and pondered. It was the first time that Ranata had
played the part of independent hostess beyond the limits
of her small court and the few privileged friends, and
the Princess was not surprised at her sudden blossoming
into a graceful, almost informal, hostess, with a word
of personal meaning for each of her guests as she greeted
them, and an animation at table which a keen sense of
liberty and her desire for popularity had finally set free.
But what puzzled and faintly alarmed the valiant but
suspicious soul of the Obersthofmeisterin was her exceeding
graciousness to the brother of her American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
friend. The Archduchess had lifted her chin coquettishly
as he bowed formally before her, and then offered
him her hand with a spontaneous warmth as she made
known her wholly feminine and unroyal pleasure in
meeting the brother of her dearest friend. To the handshake
and the remarks the Princess had no particular
objection—there was fitness in both; but why the blush
and the coquetry? Why the curiously puzzled expression
of Mr. Abbott, followed by a flash of relief and pleasure?
Why the constant change of expression as she
turned from Prince Illehazy who sat on her right to the
American who sat on her left? The Princess was abnormally
acute in the ways of her sex, and with age she
added to the sum of a knowledge born of much experience,
while forgetting nothing. It was towards the
middle of the dinner that her alarm faded, and she remarked
to herself: “She is up to some game or other.
She is playing a part. But what an actress! Who
would have suspected—but no, has she not always been
playing the parts demanded of her rank? This is merely
one of her own choosing. But what does it mean? I
must find out before I sleep to-night.”</p>

<p>Ranata, to those who knew her well, had never looked
so beautiful. She wore white, for her colored wardrobe
had not yet come, but the low bodice of her gown had
been trimmed with blue velvet flowers, and there were
sapphires on her neck instead of the usual pearls. Her
brilliant coppery hair was arranged with so many little
sparkling combs that it looked as if enmeshed in a diamond
net; and almost in front was a sapphire lily. She
had adjusted her new manner to perfection; while losing
nothing of the dignity of the princess, she was a girl
delighting in the levity of the hour, a human being conscious
to the quick of unrestricted intercourse with lively
and intelligent minds. She joined in the general conversation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
as far as was possible; pleasing and astonishing
her guests with her intimate knowledge of Hungarian
affairs and the crisis of the moment—there is always a
crisis in Hungary—her subtly expressed sympathy, and
her constant intimate references to the mother and
brother who had been so beloved by this ardent and appreciative
people. Her evident devotion to the memory
of her brother would have insured her popularity had
she reminded them less of him, been less attractive in
herself. Those within her range had no sense whatever
of being entertained by royalty; forgot the awful dinners
they had sat through with their king; were at exactly
the same informal ease as when dining with each other.
And yet, so deathless is the reverence of the monarchical
born for majesty and all begotten of majesty; so insidious
the flattery of those whose souls are steeped in purple;
that even these most independent of all monarchists
unconsciously swelled with a fuller enthusiasm for the
beautiful and gracious hostess, inasmuch as she commanded
homage by divine right.</p>

<p>During the early part of the dinner Ranata was conscious
only of the buoyant atmosphere, the gay content
of her guests, their versatility of mind, their very evident
admiration of herself, the smiling approval of the
beautiful women in the pink flood of the palm-and-flower-filled
gallery where the table was spread. It was
her first taste of power, and it was not only sweet but
inspiring. Her own enthusiasm waxed high. She felt
expansive, democratic. Her ardent nature struggled
with its bonds. She felt a momentary impulse to tell
them that she was happy for the first time in her life,
and felt as keenly as they the common bond of human
nature.</p>

<p>She hardly knew when she began to feel the subtle
difference between the American’s homage and that of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
the great Hungarian magnates. For some time her
words with him were desultory, so much of her attention
was demanded elsewhere; but as the conversation at the
long table coupled, and the beautiful Roumanian, wife
of Count Ábris Teleky, who sat on the other side of
Prince Illehazy, absorbed more and more of his attention,
she found her own consecutively claimed by Fessenden
Abbott. She had been content with the apparent
impression her coquetry and graciousness had made on
the American, reflecting with arrogance that there is
nothing so dense as the vanity of man. It was not
long before she was made aware that Fessenden, if admiring,
was not prostrate; that sensible as he might be
to her flattery, his head was still cool. But it was not
until they talked without interruption that she experienced
for the first time in her life the sensation of being
a mere woman talking to a mere man, and realized in a
flash that she had spent the early part of the evening
in a fool’s paradise. Given to self-analysis, she wondered
at its fascination, for Fessenden’s attitude after
the Chardash had been intensely irritating. But every
nerve in her had been on edge during that extraordinary
dance; however he had comported himself at its finish
would doubtless have served as a pretext for opening a
safety-valve among the sensations that were oppressing
her. To-night she was filled with good-will to all the
world; she had already sighed for democracy, and while
she sighed again at the death of an illusion, it was doubtless
consistent to accept pleasurably a momentary sensation
of true equality. That this famous American,
who was beginning to appall the world with his resource,
was dazzled by her beauty and captivated by her charm,
was apparent to whomsoever chose to observe, but it was
the surrender of man to his goddess; his eyes were level,
not upcast in the homage of courtier to princess. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
masculine vanity was flattered, no doubt, but by the
woman, not by the daughter of the Emperor of Austria.</p>

<p>For a time the conversation was impersonal enough.
“I hope you will come to my ball,” the Archduchess had
said, and then added with a laugh—“That ball! How
often its plans have been changed! The Princess Sarolta
thought that it should be given to the aristocracy alone,
but I have finally decided that all the members of Parliament
shall be invited, and all who have distinguished
themselves in art and letters. I am not very patient.
I do not like doing things by degrees. You saw Alexandra
this afternoon? I told her to take you into our
confidence.”</p>

<p>“It is a very great scheme, and I am entirely at your
disposal. But what do you intend, in this instance, to
do about the wives of your untitled members? And
the wives of your other distinguished guests who do not
come to court as a matter of course?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the women cannot come. They do not expect
it.”</p>

<p>“They would be valuable allies.”</p>

<p>“It is quite impossible. The women of the aristocracy
would rebel—would stay away from court, no doubt.”</p>

<p>“I wonder. Court life in Hungary is very rare. Surely
you are powerful enough to set your own fashions.”</p>

<p>But Ranata looked determined and unmoved. “I
should lose much and gain nothing. And, besides, I do
not wish it. An empire is an empire, not a republic.
If I opened the gates, where would be the end? I should
be shaking hands with eight thousand people of an evening,
like your poor President.”</p>

<p>“You would find that rather interesting. Your wild
and picturesque peasants—Hungarians, Roumanians,
Wallachians, Servians, Croats, Orthodox Jews, and what
not—would come pouring in from their fastnesses.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>“I shall go to them in their villages. To hold a little
court for them, as it were, will be delightful. But here—it
would be only to cheapen myself.”</p>

<p>“It would be a great victory gained if you could bring
the members of the Extreme Left to court. The Emperor
cannot; but if you invited their wives, no doubt
you would conquer their prejudices—the wives would
see to that.”</p>

<p>“Do you think I have given no thought to the Kossuths?
I have my plan of campaign. ‘Just you wait,’
as Alex would say.” She lifted her eyes and looked
directly at him; there was not even defiance in their
rays. “It has also been decided that although all the
magnates and their families will come in the national
costume, only a hundred of the younger will dance the
Chardash. The older—the men at least—seem to have
lost nothing of their fire, but I fear apoplexy.”</p>

<p>“It certainly requires the wind of youth. I suppose
I shall not be permitted to dance it,” he added discontentedly.
“Whom shall you dance it with?”</p>

<p>She hesitated a perceptible half moment; then she
answered, “I shall not dance it at all.”</p>

<p>He turned to her with a flash in his eyes, and her own
dropped. “Allow me to contribute an idea. Why not
have it danced by peasants? Many of the women have
beautiful costumes, although they do not always wear
them; enough could be found, at all events. Bring
them here—house them in the servants’ quarters for
two or three nights. Do not offer to pay anything but
their expenses. Ask them to come as a favor. Give
them a feast and dance of their own afterwards. All
the peasantry of Hungary will be delighted. Let your
other guests dance the Chardash in their own way afterwards.
You would then please everybody. I suppose
no one has dared to tell you, but the women are by no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
means enthusiastic at the prospect of having the breath
whirled out of them; and many are disappointed at not
being able to wear their latest costumes from Paris and
Vienna.”</p>

<p>“Ah! That <i>is</i> the truth, I suppose.” She laughed.
“The evolution of a ball! One would think this was the
first that ever had been heard of. But I like your idea.
Yes—it shall be. And only those who wish shall dance
the Chardash.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Fessenden quickly, “you can dance with
me afterwards. I have to wear some sort of a costume,
anyhow.”</p>

<p>She caught her breath, and again her anger rose.</p>

<p>“It is customary,” she began haughtily, then paused,
at a loss how to word her rebuke. This was not only an
American, but a sovereign in his way, and her friend’s
brother. She stole a glance at him. He had thrown
back his head, and was staring down at her with a glitter
in his eyes that made them seem peculiarly contracted.
He looked more angry than she felt. She lifted her
head and said defiantly, “I shall not dance at all.”</p>

<p>“That is a great pity,” said Fessenden coldly, “for I
never knew any one to enjoy dancing more.” Then, as
her face flushed and her own eyes glittered, he added
deliberately: “I have no intention of ignoring an experience
which I have lain awake more than one night to remember.
There is no reason why the subject should be
taboo, and it makes an absurd and annoying complication.
Do you expect me to be eternally on my guard
lest I make a reference to it?”</p>

<p>For a moment the Archduchess did not answer. Her
next words must decide the status of their future acquaintance,
possibly would determine whether they ever met
again or not. There was no mistaking the gauntlet he
had thrown down: she was to take him on his own terms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
or not at all. Should she? Should she? Her anger
had ebbed in an unaccountable manner. There was
something very alluring in the prospect not only of a
new variety of homage, but of adventuring farther on
the path of liberty. Many changes had lifted their
heads within her since her break for comparative independence
and her rapid victory. She was beginning to
perceive how fatally easy it is for women and nations to
cross the border between liberty and license. Four days
ago she had made an appalling addition to the limited
sum of her experiences: she had known for a few moments
the intoxication of abandonment. The retrospect
had filled her with an alternate fury and delight. Woman-like
she had vented her wrath on the man; and he
had commanded her waking thoughts to the exclusion
of the Austrian dynasty. Then, with the elaborate subtlety
of the feminine mind, she had persuaded herself
that her duty to her country demanded that she win the
American from the man who menaced the future integrity
of the Austrian Empire; and, buoyed up by the
virtue of her cause, she had drawn him into the circle of
her influence, having first analyzed him into the abstract
condition of a curiosity. During the last half-hour she
had quite forgotten that virtue alone had summoned
Fessenden Abbott to court; but as she hesitated, fascinated,
but doubting the policy of letting him eat the
fruits of victory, the devil, which sits on his tail in a
corner of every woman’s brain, plucked this virtue from
its hook and flung it into the light.</p>

<p>She raised her brilliant powerful eyes to his and said
sweetly: “You have placed me in a position from which
there are only two outlets. I acknowledge myself defeated.
What is it you would like to say about our
Chardash? I am quite ready to discuss it threadbare.”</p>

<p>He laughed, but without annoyance, for she had uttered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
the words “our Chardash” in a tone that gave him
a sharp sensation of delight. “The laurels are to you,”
he said with commendable sobriety. “It is my turn to
acknowledge defeat. I shall never mention the subject
again except at your command.”</p>

<p>She had accomplished her purpose, and should have
been satisfied. But she was filled with a sudden desire
to hear all that he had left unsaid. What had he wanted
to tell her? How had he felt for her that day? What
did the memory mean to him? She cast about in her
mind for the words that would express a delicate and
elusive query, to lead him on, while not committing herself.
But an interview with a Königsegg was a simple
matter beside playing with fire when the fire was actually
between one’s fingers; the hereditary game of coquetry
was no guide. Nonplussed, but unwilling to
leave the subject, she bit her lip and drew a long breath.</p>

<p>“What are you sighing about?” asked Fessenden.</p>

<p>“I am a woman and inconsistent.”</p>

<p>“I know less about women than you do, so I can’t
help you out—at all events unless you tell me what is
the matter with you.”</p>

<p>“Alexandra is direct, but she has a great deal of subtlety!”</p>

<p>“I haven’t a particle of subtlety. I’ll give a direct
answer to a direct question from anybody but a South
American president or a Chinaman. What is it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I’ll tell you,” said Ranata hurriedly.
“How I long to hear all your adventures at first hand!
Even listening to Alexandra, I have held my breath.
But we are going to have our coffee on the terrace.”</p>

<p>A few moments later, as the company was standing
about the pillared gallery behind the vines, the Princess
Sarolta took Alexandra’s arm and strolled with her beyond
the others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>“Why are you angry?” asked the watchful Obersthofmeisterin.</p>

<p>“Ranata is trying to make a fool of my brother.”</p>

<p>“You are making a fool of Zrinyi. Your brother has
doubtless been made a fool of before. I was afraid that
Ranata was taking man—in the person of your brother—as
seriously as she has taken all life heretofore.”</p>

<p>Alexandra was on the alert at once. “You are quite
mistaken,” she said indifferently. “Ranata has a very
particular reason for turning my brother’s head. I promised,
in a moment of enthusiasm, to help her. I do not
know that that would hold, but I am in a quandary. I
want Ranata to succeed in all that she has undertaken,
but I do not want my brother sacrificed.”</p>

<p>“At your age tender consideration for a man is a characteristic!
It is one of the amusing reminiscences of
age. When you have learned, my child, how much
they can stand—<i>enfin!</i> I am relieved that it is this
way, for although I hope to have Ranata under my supervision
when she goes through the inevitable, yet I
shrink from it—and there is little I do shrink from!
She would suffer quite horribly, because she must be
utterly without hope; even intrigue would be forbidden
her—she has too much at stake. But no! as well now
as any time. As well your brother as any man. He looks
as if he would never <i>affiché</i> a woman, he is not hot of head,
he knows the world—and lives on the other side of it!”</p>

<p>“You are all wrong, Sarolta. Ranata is playing a game.”</p>

<p>“The game is fire,” replied the Princess dryly.</p>

<p>After that Fessenden took his tea—he detested tea—every
day in the Hungarian house. Sometimes the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
entire court was present, all conforming to the English
custom approved by their princess, except the Obersthofmeisterin,
who consumed glass after glass of iced
coffee, to the secret envy of the rest. Sometimes only
the younger ladies-in-waiting were present besides the
Archduchess and Alexandra; but even at dinner, to
which he was frequently invited, Fessenden rarely had
a word alone with Ranata. Twice he had ridden with
the court to the summit of the Schwabenberg in the
early morning, but he had been obliged to content himself
with observing the fine effect of flaming hair among
the sweeping branches of the acacia.</p>

<p>If Fessenden had not long since come to the conclusion
that it was a waste of man’s valuable time to puzzle
over the idiosyncrasies of any woman, he would have
wondered at the sudden change in the Archduchess’s
tactics. She had dropped coquetry as abruptly as she
had assumed it, and now treated him with a sisterly
frankness which, in some respects, was a curious imitation
of Alexandra’s. The truth was that Ranata had
taken warning from an angry glint in her friend’s eye,
although the subject of Fessenden had been mutually
avoided. Moreover, Ranata had informed herself that
the American’s friendship would doubtless be as valuable
to the House of Hapsburg as his love, and far easier for
her inexperienced self to manage. He had thrilled her
unaccountably in the Chardash, and startled and fascinated
her later by his momentary conquest of her will;
but she had finally taken alarm, and when he arose in
her thought she wrote a letter to Count von Königsegg,
or demanded the company of her lively ladies-in-waiting.
When she was alone in bed she sternly reviewed
the Hungarian programme, and forced herself to plan
for the subjugation of the Party of Independence. On
this question she had much correspondence with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
minister; for she had received more than one veiled command
to let politics ostensibly alone while exercising the
purely feminine forces of attraction to bind all parties
in a common loyalty to the throne. This was not a
difficult task for a beautiful and intelligent princess
within the circle of her influence; but if a powerful
band of enthusiastic Radicals chose to keep themselves
far beyond the outer edge of that circle, how was she,
hedged by every restriction, to cast her nets about them?
She did not regard Fessenden’s suggestion as feasible—not
for the present at least. If all else failed, however,
she finally decided, with a secret preference for following
his advice, that she would summon the most influential
women of the aristocracy in secret conclave, and,
appealing to their patriotism, ask them to come forth
temporarily from their haughty exclusiveness and meet
the women of the dangerous element within the neutral
shades of the palace. She had discussed this plan with
her mentor, and it had been agreed upon as a last resort.</p>

<p>The enthusiasm and curiosity she excited among the
masses were sufficient to satisfy the most patriotic and
feminine heart. Every day from four to five she drove
abroad, taking invariably the same route; crossing the
suspension-bridge and driving out the wide Andrássy <i>ut</i>
into the Stefenia <i>ut</i> of the park. All Pest seemed to
tumble into the streets and the footways of the bridge
as she passed, and frequently there was cheering. Beloved
as her father was in Vienna, his people showed
him no further attention in public than a perfunctory
salute; and although in Hungary the masses cheered
him during his brief visits, it was much in the same manner
as the American is enthusiastic over any spectacle
that varies the monotony of business. But that the
people of Budapest were not only genuinely delighted
with this flower of the Hapsburgs, but pleased and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
flattered that she chose to live among them, was evident
both by their spontaneous enthusiasm and its reflection
in the press. In all but the Radical newspapers there
was a daily chronicle of her doings, and gallant comment;
the opposition had nothing to say in her disfavor,
and was evidently unsuspicious of her motive in deserting
Vienna for Budapest.</p>

<p>One morning, persuaded by Alexandra, she entered a
shop for the first time in her life. It was a shop in the
Vácri utcza, and she spent a delighted half-hour to the
greater delight of the sordid soul that kept it. When
she left it she was mobbed into her carriage by a throng
that impeded the traffic. She passed through the ordeal
with such a lack of condescension in her good-nature
that even the women cheered her, and there were murmurs
of “Rudolf!” among their “<i>Élyens!</i>” When
driving past the waiting crowds in the street, instead of
favoring her admirers with the usual fixed smile and
stately bow of bored royalty, she inclined her head
slowly, including many in one salutation, and sometimes
smiling in a manner that seemed both spontaneous
and personal.</p>

<p>And then, one other morning, accompanied only by
the Princess Sarolta, Fessenden, and Alexandra, she visited
the Hall of the Deputies, the Lower House of the
Diet. The new Parliament building, that epitome of
Venice on the brink of the Danube, was unfinished, and
both houses of the Diet still met in the old buildings in
the “Magnates’ Quarter.” Ranata insisted upon sitting
quietly in the diplomats’ gallery for a time, and found
much food for reflection. The magnates meet irregularly;
the Deputies daily while Parliament is in session, and
transact the business of the nation when not engaged in
moving their kings and pawns a square further towards
independence. One finds no type in Budapest, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
these were men of many types. Few possessed the
famed Hungarian beauty, and the majority looked like
energetic business-men whose native fires were nicely
balanced by determination. They were curiously unmonarchical
in appearance and atmosphere; and the unenlightened
stranger would have assumed without question
that they were the working body of an aggressive
republic. The ministry, striking-looking men, all of the
Liberal party, sat in a semicircle below the desk of the
President of the House, and followed the proceedings
with evident cynicism.</p>

<p>The President, one of the few nobles in the Lower
House, was lecturing the Party of Independence upon the
inconvenient extreme to which it was carrying its policy
of obstruction. He sat aloft, and the beautiful Magyar
language rolled down, an impassioned yet monotonous
torrent. The constant interruptions from the Extreme
Left in nowise disturbed it. The “Young Kossuth
party” acted much in the fashion of bad boys too big
for the ferrule.</p>

<p>“They need Tom Reed,” muttered Fessenden.</p>

<p>“They interest me very much,” whispered Ranata.
“I have never seen anything like them. Do they represent
Hungary?”</p>

<p>“That is what they are here for.”</p>

<p>“Your House of Representatives—does it look more
democratic?”</p>

<p>“Only when it has its coat off and its feet on the desk.”</p>

<p>“These men—why do they want William? Why do
they want any king?”</p>

<p>“The great body are not extremists. They know
that Hungary is not ready for independence—neither
internally nor by her geographical position. No country
is surrounded by so many enemies—who hate her for
that obstinate individuality which has survived every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
reverse and threatens to engulf themselves. The Hungarians
would make their own terms with William—and
give him their help in smashing Russia.”</p>

<p>“Is this matter the talk of Europe?” asked the Archduchess
sharply.</p>

<p>“Not of Europe, but of those who do the hard thinking.”</p>

<p>“How could William smash Russia?”</p>

<p>“He only needs the money.”</p>

<p>“Ah! He promised his grandfather on the old Kaiser’s
death-bed that he would maintain friendly relations
with Russia. It is a matter of sentiment with
him.”</p>

<p>“Sentiment evaporates, and promises are nullified,
when it comes to a question of self-protection.”</p>

<p>“Or ambition! Will he ever be able to get this
money? The Reichstag will not vote it, and the Socialists
become stronger daily. How can he get it?”</p>

<p>“Well—he might raise the embargo on certain American
industries, and as a return favor they might advance
him fifty million dollars or so.”</p>

<p>“You know that is one of the few things he would not
dare do. He cannot afford to antagonise another party—he
is as much of a politician as your Roosevelt.”</p>

<p>“Well, you see, success in a great war would bind all
parties in a common approval.”</p>

<p>Ranata was a thorough European in the sinuousness
of her methods; but she recalled the picturesque advice
of Alexandra to push a fellow-diplomat into a corner and
tell him “to speak out or get out.” She fixed her disconcerting
eyes on Fessenden and asked deliberately,
“Do you intend to give him this money?”</p>

<p>Fessenden was not to be nonplussed by methods direct
or indirect. His sharp eyes met the strength of
her gaze unmoved. “Can you keep a secret? Yes?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
If the time ever comes when our interests seem one, I
shall let him have all the money he wants.”</p>

<p>“That is the vagueness of diplomacy.”</p>

<p>“I have no immediate intention of putting my hand
in my pocket, if that is what you mean. Nor is the
time ripe for him to strike.”</p>

<p>Ranata drew a long breath. To bridge an interval she
asked, “Is it true—I mean in your personal knowledge—that
the Balkan states would rally to him in case of a
war with Russia—that they share the infatuated notion
that he is destined to be the savior of eastern Europe—instead
of ourselves!”</p>

<p>“I am as sure of it as one can be of anything in Eastern
politics.”</p>

<p>“And this story I heard yesterday—that he is having
his second son taught Hungarian—is that true?”</p>

<p>“I heard it in Berlin, but not from the Emperor.”</p>

<p>For a moment Ranata hated him. Then she registered
a vow anew, and this time her chin seemed to absorb
its firm pink flesh. She turned to Fessenden pettishly.
“I hate politics!” she said. “I shall play my
part here quietly, but there is no necessity to talk or
even to think about it, except when I am obliged to discuss
some point with Count von Königsegg. Of course,
if you have advice to give me I shall be grateful, but at
other times please forget and let me forget that I am
an unhappy princess imagining I have the fate of an
empire on my shoulders.”</p>

<p>“I am not in Hungary to talk politics.”</p>

<p>Ranata lifted her eyes to his; they were both soft and
dazzling. “Why are you here?” she whispered audaciously.</p>

<p>The fires in Fessenden flew to his head and flashed
from his eyes, but his voice if unsteady came to her ear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
distinctly. “If we are ever alone for a moment I will
tell you why.”</p>

<p>Ranata received her first electric shock of passion.
He had won again and with her own weapons. Tumultuous
delight, amazement, anger, rushed through
her brain. She clinched her hand in an attempt at self-control,
and it slipped from her knee and touched his.
She recovered herself at once.</p>

<p>“One would think you were a Hungarian!” she said
scornfully, oblivious of the significance of her failure to
comment upon the ancient ocean that rolled between
them. “They need only a spark, and are accustomed
to women who are always expectant of the language of
love. From Alexandra I have gathered that the American
man has been too well educated by his women to
let himself go until he is sure he will not be laughed at,
and that he is greatly assisted by the national frigidity
of temperament.”</p>

<p>“What you learn of the national temperament will
be from me, not from my sister.”</p>

<p>Ranata was now fully alive to her rôle. That her
being was still in tumult, her brain alert with womanly
curiosity, mattered nothing; she would follow her programme
to the end. If that end were unimaginable for
the woman, it was defined enough for the princess.</p>

<p>“I should like to know one man in my life,” she murmured.
“And you are an American—the only one I
ever could know, I suppose. I find the prospect rather
delightful. But you must not insist upon flirting with
me. It would be an unfair advantage—I am terribly
unskilled.”</p>

<p>“I have not the slightest intention of flirting with
you. I have had no time to learn the <i>a b c</i> of flirtation.
Nor do I waste my time.”</p>

<p>“How long shall you stay in Hungary?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>“I know less about that than you do.”</p>

<p>“But you do not take long vacations. Surely, your
enormous interests in America—they must demand your
attention before long.”</p>

<p>“My enormous interests can—take care of themselves.”</p>

<p>The blood ran up to Ranata’s hair. For a second she
forgot her rôle. She tasted the sweets of woman’s power
for the first time, and wondered at the barrenness of
the regal. “Would you stay here if your great fortune
were in danger—if—”</p>

<p>“I should stay here if the world went to smash.”</p>

<p>Ranata became aware that Alexandra’s lips were at
her other ear. “Sarolta is going to sleep,” whispered
the warning voice. “She will be horribly cross. Hadn’t
we better go?”</p>

<p>The Archduchess rose. “Yes,” she said indifferently.
“It is quite time. And we have promised to go on the
floor for a moment. The President has left his seat.
Doubtless he is coming to meet us.”</p>

<p>A few moments later she was receiving the compliments
of the ministers, most of whom she had met while
her father was in Budapest. She was Archduchess of
Austria and Princess of Hungary once more, touched
with the happy informality of her brother. The members
of the press had been requested to leave the room.
The Deputies were standing at their desks regarding her
with deep attention, and she played to them quite as
much as to the ministers. She stood just beneath the
elevated seat of the President, and its sombre dignity
made the proper background for her noble height and
brilliant hair. She wore a large black hat and a gown
of black velvet whose jacket opened over the white softness
of chiffons. The color was still in her cheeks, her
eyes sparkled, her short upper lip curved in a smile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
which was less gracious than youthful, and revealed
teeth whose like from time immemorial have inspired
man with longing and forgiveness.</p>

<p>Her eyes wandered several times to the benches of the
Extreme Left. These men also stood at their posts.
There was one who overtopped his fellows by a head.
This head was shaped like a cannon-ball and surrounded
by harsh black hair. His nose was short and thick, but
the face was strongly built and the small black eyes
dashed beneath a permanent frown.</p>

<p>She turned to the President. “Who is that man?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“Molnár Lajos.” He gave the names in the Hungarian
sequence. “He is one of the most influential and
violent of the Obstructionists, and gives us far more
trouble than the son of Kossuth.”</p>

<p>“Present him to me.”</p>

<p>The great Liberal magnate hesitated. He thought of
his king and turned pale. His eye sought that of the
Obersthofmeisterin. She raised her brows expressively
and lifted one shoulder. The President, wondering, for
he had known Sarolta through many imperious years,
turned and walked over to the young Radical. For a
moment it was apparent that the disciple of Kossuth
hesitated, but he had the courtesy of his race, and he
hardly could decline to meet even an archduchess whose
smiling eyes were not twenty feet from his. Moreover,
she was young and beautiful. He felt that an apologetic
glance at his colleagues was unnecessary, and a
moment later he was bowing stiffly before the daughter
of the king he hated.</p>

<p>Ranata began in the royal manner. “I found your
remarks very interesting. Do you speak often?”</p>

<p>“My painful duty compels me to, your Royal Highness.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>“Painful?” She looked at him with melting eyes.
“Are you ill? Pardon me—you look very strong.”</p>

<p>“You misunderstand me.” (“I will not tag on your
Royal Highness to every sentence,” he registered.) “It
is Hungary that is ill.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Of course I know that you must refer to politics,
Úr Molnár.” The name of a man or woman, unexpectedly
introduced, can be made the vehicle of the
subtlest flattery, of a half-timid hint of deepening interest,
may even foreshadow a caress. Ranata’s rich voice
uttered the commonplace name, with its long vowel,
in a manner to mount to the head of any man. Wholly
unused to the effort to please, she would have enjoyed
this new exercise of power with all that was feminine
in her nature, had the dynasty been rooted in the fires
of the earth.</p>

<p>Molnár was young, he was barely thirty. He was
ardent and susceptible, and for the moment he was not
in love. And although he hated the House of Hapsburg
as passionately as ever his great master had done, still
was he monarchical born; the soul that could hate kings
and love liberty was haunted by the ghosts of ancestors
who had lived and died in reverence of the Lord’s
anointed. The poison was entering his nostrils. If Ranata
had looked like most princesses doubtless he would
have held sternly to his ideals. But she was the most
beautiful woman he had ever seen, and her ineffable air
of breeding, her sweet condescension, and the changing
expression of her powerful eyes were pumping the blood
to his head. He made a final grasp for his politics and
his pride.</p>

<p>“It is your happiness, madame, that you can afford to
know nothing about politics.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I wonder if I can? I have been much enlightened
to-day. Enough so to understand your meaning.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
Should I not know more? Can any member of
my family afford to misunderstand this most important
part of our Empire? It is true that I am only a woman—but
at least I have some influence with my father.
Will you not advise me?”</p>

<p>“Your Royal Highness,” stammered Molnár. “Your
Royal— Yes, of course you should understand our
politics—would to Heaven that you did!”</p>

<p>“Whom shall I ask? I am in a position to hear only
one side. Ah!” Her face was radiant. “You will
come to the palace and give us a little lecture. My ball
is to-morrow night. We can arrange then for an hour
when you are not too busy to talk to us.”</p>

<p>“I cannot go to your ball, your Royal Highness—none
of the Left will go.”</p>

<p>“Not come to my ball? Why not?”</p>

<p>“We never enter the palace.”</p>

<p>“But my ball has nothing to do with politics. I am
not your sovereign. I have my father’s permission to
live here this winter because my American friend and I
are so tired of Vienna, and I am so fascinated by your
city. I wish to enjoy Budapest, Úr Molnár. Is my
winter to be poisoned by party feeling?—of which I
know too little. How illogical, and how ungallant!
You will come and bring your colleagues to-morrow
night? It is to be the great night of my life, and I am
sure you will not spoil it.”</p>

<p>“I? Ah!” Once more he braced himself. “I am
afraid there will not be enough women to go round, your
Royal Highness,” he said meaningly.</p>

<p>“That was clever. But”—she spoke very softly—“wait.
I cannot do everything at once. I have an
Obersthofmeisterin. Remember that you are far more
your own master than I am mistress of my acts.”</p>

<p>As she finally dismissed the bewildered Obstructionist,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
she caught Fessenden’s eye. It was twinkling with appreciation
of a fellow-man’s enslavement. Ranata saw
in the twinkle approval of her manœuvres in a great
cause, and responded to the new chord of sympathy
with all a woman’s facile manufacture of subtle understandings
with unconscious man.</p>

<p>“I feel somewhat of a Jesuit,” she said to him as they
left the building. “But it is success or failure, and I
shall not fail.”</p>

<p>“Your tactics are those of the man who wins. And I
suppose you reason that men will fall in love with you
anyhow—that one more or less doesn’t matter.”</p>

<p>“That is an idea!” said Ranata.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">XVI</h3>
</div>

<p>After luncheon the two girls, by Alexandra’s manœuvring,
were alone in Ranata’s sitting-room. It was
a very beautiful room now, with its golden walls, its rich
Oriental hangings and chairs. The windows were open,
and the Hungarian sunshine flooded it. Ranata sat in
one of the deep straight-back chairs so beloved of royalty,
Alexandra in a rocking-chair which had been upholstered
to match the rest of the furniture, yet was impertinent
and incongruous. “There is only one thing
that will reconcile me to parting with you when you
marry,” the Archduchess had remarked when it arrived;
“I can have a bonfire made of all those ridiculous
chairs.” And Alexandra had replied, “I will convert
you even to those before I die.”</p>

<p>To-day neither was sensible of pleasantries. Alexandra’s
face was flushed, and the Archduchess, although
her eyes were fixed absently on Pest, and her profile
might have been cut in stone, was bracing herself for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
coming conflict. Her subtle brain cleared and balanced
its parts. She was determined to lose neither her friend
nor her friend’s brother, and an ill-considered word might
lose her both. She needed all her resources, for no one
understood her so well as Alexandra.</p>

<p>“You know I never beat about the bush,” the disconcerting
American began. “You would think me a
fool if I pretended any longer to be blind to the fact that
you are entangling my brother in order the better to
turn the tables on the German Emperor. If he were any
one else’s brother I should follow your course with pleasure—I
was as delighted as amused at your easy subjugation
of poor Molnár this morning; for I am, up to a certain
point, heart and soul with you in this great matter—but
Fessenden is my brother.”</p>

<p>“I wish he were not. Can you look at this matter
dispassionately and impersonally, Alexandra? Do
you believe that I can succeed as well without your
brother?”</p>

<p>“Possibly not. But I see no reason why any American,
much less the most useful young man in the United
States, should be sacrificed to the Austrian dynasty. If
it were a matter concerning your happiness, I might
hesitate, for I love you as well as I do Fessenden; but
when patriotism goes into the balance with family affection,
pride also casts in a heavy weight.”</p>

<p>“But why do you speak so surely of sacrifice? Men
are always falling in love with women, and always getting
over it.”</p>

<p>“I have thought a good deal in the last few days. If
Fessenden fell in love with you, he would have a hideous
time getting over it—if he ever did.”</p>

<p>“If he fell in love with me? You do not think he has,
then?”</p>

<p>“He is in the first stage now. I suppose a man can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
get over that. But quite aside from his feelings, I don’t
wish to see him made a fool of.”</p>

<p>“I have no desire to make a fool of him.”</p>

<p>“I should like to know what you call it. Do not let
us quibble. If you cannot love my brother send him
away.”</p>

<p>“How would it help the matter if I did love your
brother? I hope you do not wish me any such unhappy
fate as that.”</p>

<p>“I wish only for your happiness. You know that
from my point of view the impossible is always possible.
And it is not altogether the American point of view.
Heaven knows the Hapsburgs have adopted it more than
once. I hear that another of your illustrious cousins is
about to renounce his rights of possible succession, and
his titles, in order to marry an actress—or is it a girl in a
chocolate shop?”</p>

<p>“They are insignificant—they lose nothing but their
titles and their position at court, for which presumably
they care nothing. And you know my sorrow and disgust
at all such poverty of self-respect and sense of duty.
We need not go over that old ground again. You know
that with me it would always be my house first. I
should never consider myself for a moment.”</p>

<p>“Then send my brother away. He was an after-thought.
You had made all your plans to succeed
without him.”</p>

<p>“I am convinced that when William has made his
Germany as strong and prosperous—when he has fulfilled
that first ideal of his reign—and when my father is
dead—he means to make war on Russia, and that your
brother means to furnish the enormous sum necessary.
And if William conquered Russia—” she waved her
hands expressively.</p>

<p>“It is by no means certain that William will conquer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
Russia. It is a large order. The rest of Europe, to say
nothing of England, would have something to say about
it.”</p>

<p>“With the best part of Austria and all of Hungary
at his back he could snap his fingers at the rest of Europe.
Without the interference of Russia in 1849, Hungary
would be a free state to-day, and she only waits for
her chance of revenge. Who knows what agencies are
at work to give reality to the Pan-Germanic movement
the moment my father dies? Bohemia might sympathize
with Russia, but what could she do, hemmed in as
she is? Besides, the Slavs outside of Russia have little
desire to put themselves under the heel of the heaviest
tyranny in Europe. Most of them would prefer annexation
with Germany, if only because the German Emperor
has learned the secret of prosperity. If he tempted
them with that inducement, you may be sure that only
a Pole would hesitate and stand out for complete independence.
All this enthusiasm here for William in Hungary
is genuine enough, no doubt, but Budapest is as
active and ambitious as Berlin, and a ruler who could and
would make Hungary as rich and as successful, industrially
and commercially, as she should be with her resources
and her enterprise, would be quite as acceptable
if he were less fascinating. And I will confess that I
am superstitious about William. I never raise my eyes
to the heavens at night that I do not fancy I see his star
laughing at me. Indomitable ambition has united Europe
before. There is no sufficient reason why it should
not happen again. Before every great change of the
world’s map wiseacres have shrugged their shoulders at
the impossible, and the barriers have been solemnly
pronounced impregnable. How easy it all seems when
one looks back upon it. And with your brother—perhaps
the United States—as his ally—great Heaven! If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
I were William I should sleep serenely enough, in spite
of all the antagonistic forces in Germany itself. And
he grows in tact. He has the brain to learn his lessons.”</p>

<p>“And it is your purpose to reduce Fessenden to such
a state of idiocy that he would give you his pledge to let
William take care of himself? Suppose he had already
given his word to the Emperor of Germany? Have you
not seen enough of him to know that he is a man who
under no possible circumstances would break his word?”</p>

<p>“I have seen enough to know that he is a man who
would give the one woman the world if she asked for it.
It is not necessary to break promises. There can be misunderstandings,
quarrels, which leave men mutually free
of one another.”</p>

<p>Alexandra drew her breath in and her brows together.
She had hardly expected such frankness, well as she knew
the methods of diplomacy. But she answered readily:
“A man does not sacrifice his honor and his friendship,
and place the world at the feet of the adored object with
no hope of reward. Do you mean to say that you purpose
to dazzle my brother with the hope of ultimate
success?”</p>

<p>“No; it will not be long before we understand each
other too completely for that!”</p>

<p>“What <i>do</i> you mean?”</p>

<p>A deep blush suffused Ranata’s face, and she stood up
suddenly. “I believe I shall love your brother,” she
said distinctly. “I believe it is my destiny as surely
as it is that I was born to be useful to my house. I
have never seen another man who has touched—has interested
me at all. There has never been any hope in my
heart that I should not love sooner or later—perhaps no
wish. Would you take this from me—from him? Cannot
you understand what a great love may mean to
natures like mine and your brother’s—that the earthly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
consummation of love has nothing to do with its immortal
part? Your brother did not receive your letter
asking him to come here. We met by the merest accident—apparently!—and
he interested me quite independently
of my ambitions, my purpose. If ambition
and purpose had never been born I should implore you
as I do now to let him remain near me as long as possible.
I shall not relax in my determination to win him
from the Emperor of Germany, but there is so much in
my soul to give! I shall give it to him—and I believe
he will be satisfied.”</p>

<p>Alexandra, who had been repelled by the half revelation
of purely human passion, thrilled at the vision of
poetic and spiritual love high on the snowy peaks of
Imagination. Ranata looked too exalted to kiss, but
the American girl was delighted to find the infrequent
tears in her own eyes. In a moment, however, her practical
brain replied:</p>

<p>“I don’t believe Fessenden is very sentimental. You
will have to educate him.”</p>

<p>“He needs less education than you think.”</p>

<p>“Of course you have already begun to idealize him.
He is accustomed to get what he wants. He loves obstacles—and
he always surmounts them.”</p>

<p>“I shall give him what he wants.”</p>

<p>Alexandra considered. She had little regard for the
ultimate wants of men, had, indeed, given them slight
consideration. But she knew that man was extremely
prosaic on the subject of matrimony, and she was allured
by the prospect of beholding her brother, purified
of earthly gross, standing alone on a lofty peak,
wrapped in the chastity of spiritual love. She shivered
slightly, and Fessenden, somehow, seemed to slip out
of the picture; but it pleased her nevertheless, and it
was not unlike her own cool and romantic visions of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
Ranata’s future. Besides, it was not necessarily final.
There was always the possibility that Fessenden, if induced
to climb his peak, would stay on it only long
enough to create a scheme for the further and final subjugation
of Ranata. She answered after a moment’s
thinking—</p>

<p>“You have put such an entirely different complexion
on it! I should be a fiend to betray you. William and
Fessenden both know how to take care of themselves.
I’m frightfully interested, old girl, and I’ll never turn a
hair again.”</p>

<p>When Ranata was alone she sat straight in her chair
and stared hard at the floor. “How much of that did
I mean?” she said finally and aloud. “How much! I
wish to God I knew!”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">XVII</h3>
</div>

<p>Immediately after tea the Archduchess rose to leave
the Hungarian house, saying that she had letters to
write, neglected in the morning. She had included all
in the slight explanation, but as she passed Fessenden
she raised her eyes irresistibly. He was looking as
haughty and distant as she was attempting to feel.
Again their positions were subtly reversed.</p>

<p>“Would you like to see my new rooms?” she asked
hurriedly. “I think them very charming. Perhaps
you will come up with Alexandra—in an hour?”</p>

<p>When she had gone Fessenden turned to his sister.
“Wouldn’t you like to walk about the garden?” he
asked. “You do not take half as much exercise as
you should.”</p>

<p>They did not walk far. As soon as they reached a
rustic seat out of sight of the others, and Fessenden had
made sure there were no lurking places for eavesdroppers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
they sat down, and he began at once, as if pursuing
aloud the current of his thoughts—</p>

<p>“The great uncle, Frederick William IV., of the Emperor
of Germany was mad, and there has been no suggestion
of insanity in the family since. That disproves
not only the alternate generation theory, but that insanity
is necessarily persistent.”</p>

<p>“What on earth are you driving at?”</p>

<p>“A good many things have kept me awake at night
lately, and one of them is the uncomfortable number of
lunatics in the royal and ducal families of Bavaria.” He
added deliberately: “I mean that the late Empress, and
her cousins, Ludvig II. and the present Otto, seem to
hover ever behind the Archduchess Ranata, three black
and stalking ghosts.”</p>

<p>“I thought you knew your Europe.”</p>

<p>“I have no time to waste in analyzing court gossip.
But do you mean to say that these three were not mad?”</p>

<p>“Elizabeth was no more mad than I am, and the other
two lost their minds through specific causes. If I don’t
know anything else, I know the facts about every royalty
in Europe; I have been brought up on them.”</p>

<p>“Well, explain,” said Fessenden impatiently. “And
don’t let your loyalty and your imagination run away
with you.”</p>

<p>“You must have learned that the commonplace world
always revenges itself on an unusual character by believing
it mad. Doubtless you have been called mad
yourself. It is only recently that people have resigned
themselves to the sanity of the German Emperor. Elizabeth
hated the footlights as much as he loves them,
and publicity has readjusted him to the common estimate.
The ever-increasing seclusion of her life deepened
the mystery and the gossip, and both confirmed
those who were not in a position to learn the truth, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
the belief that an empress who spurned a throne must
necessarily have lost her wits. At the other extreme
are psychic enthusiasts—over here in Europe—who already
have begun The Legend of Elizabeth. A legend
of some sort was inevitable, for she was royal, beautiful,
unhappy, mysterious, and died a violent death. These
enthusiasts knew as little of her personally as the world
in general, but their imaginations are of finer fibre, and
there was much in this lovely and romantic figure to
appeal to them. No doubt, a hundred years from now
Elizabeth will be one of the most irresistible figures of
the past to the poet and the romancer, for the legend
that the members of this cult have set on foot will grow
and strengthen daily. Their belief is that she was one
of those rare beings who are too exalted for human contact,
and that the development of her natural superiority
was one of the most remarkable in the psychic history
of mortals. Profoundly imbued, according to them,
with the doctrine that a man should develop his personality
at the expense of every duty, every affection, of
kin or subject, she withdrew herself more and more, not
only from the world, but from her husband and children,
that she might devote her thoughts only to what was
beautiful, live the inner life alone, and develop her personality
in a manner possible to most people only after
they have cast off the flesh; that her sensitiveness in
time became so great that contact with common mortals
was unbearable. That is the legend, and, mark my
words, before a century has passed she will be painted
with a halo about her head. It will be only the glamour
of royalty, but the world will never suspect that.</p>

<p>“This is the truth of the matter—like all truth, to be
found midway between two extremes of belief: Elizabeth
was a simple creature, bright, sweet, lovely, but,
although highly accomplished, moderately gifted in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
matter of intellect and strength of character. Nature
never intended her to mount a throne. She should have
married for love a man who would have been faithful
to her, and lived a life without the ostentation and public
duties she hated, a life that would have been filled
with all the refined pleasures. Instead of that the poor
child was suddenly shot from her simple country home,
where hardly a whisper of the world and its ways had
reached her, up to the most formal and exacting throne
in Europe. Here she was not only tormented by her
mother-in-law, but by the rapidly waning love of her
husband, to whom at that time she was much attached.
She was too young and too undisciplined to accept her
fate with philosophy; nor did she ever develop the
strength of intellect and character which enables a disappointed
woman to conquer life. Life conquered her,
poor thing; as a queen and a woman she was a failure.
First, while she was very young, she ran away and
sulked for several years. She returned, but only to absent
herself more and more from a life which she detested
increasingly. It is quite true that she loved the
beautiful things of this world—art, music, literature—above
all, nature. In many ways she was an exquisite
creature, and in these congenial resources she found
much compensation for the constant unhappiness and
the terrible tragedies of her life. Every person of refined
tastes cares less and less for the world as he grows
older. When the most excruciating disappointments
crown this natural tendency, and there is not ambition
to dominate experience, then most men and women of
Elizabeth’s age live much the same sort of life that she
did; and the world knows too little about them to call
them either mad or psychic phenomena. So much for
Elizabeth—and let no one grudge her success in legend
as a compensation for the failure of her life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>“As to Ludvig—”</p>

<p>“A moment,” interrupted Fessenden, “what of Rudolf?”</p>

<p>“Rudolf had suffered frightfully from headaches for
several months before he died, brought on by the dissipations
into which he plunged to drown the miseries of
his life. He was one of the most rarely gifted of the
Hapsburgs, from the first Rudolf down; he had no responsibilities
to occupy his brilliant and restless mind;
he had a great weakness for women, and they pursued
him; his domestic life was wretched; he sought oblivion
in every possible way, and the autopsy proved that he
had unhinged his brain. He undoubtedly killed himself
in a wild moment of intolerable <i>ennui</i> and disgust. That
Marie Vetsera was present adds little to the significance
of his death. It might as well have been any other
woman, and Rudolf was incapable of the pathos of a
romantic suicide. As to his insanity, it was not congenital;
and there was no sign of it before he gave himself
up to his last dissipations.</p>

<p>“Ludvig was born with no other screw loose than an
inordinate admiration of himself and the actor’s disposition
to startle the world from the centre of the stage.
All little kings—and some big ones—have a disproportionate
idea of their own importance; and to realize the
extreme point to which Ludvig, after his brain became
clouded, carried this not unnatural delusion, you have
only to visit his castle of Neu-Schwanstein and look at the
throne room. It was not even built before Bavaria became
a mere state of the German Empire, and yet it has
the proportions and the splendor suitable for one of the
three or four great monarchs of the earth. And this,
not in his capital, but in one of his many castles! But
Ludvig’s passion for beauty, his patronage of Wagner,
and the splendid monuments he has raised in Bavaria<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
to his own artistic genius, make him quite worthy of the
inevitable legend. If you will look at his photographs,
even those taken after he became gross and had suffered
from many attacks of insanity, you will see that his eyes
were always the eyes of the idealist. It was to this very
idealism that he owed his insanity. Above all others
was the monastic ideal of chastity, but he did not have
the self-denial to live on monastic fare; and he was a
king, and there was everything in his life to give his
brain and imagination a preternatural activity. The
consequence was periodical attacks of insanity, and the
accentuation of his original peculiarities; towards the
end, no doubt, he was vicious enough. The same thing
might happen to any American, although, of course,
centuries of interbreeding render the brain more susceptible
to abnormal conditions. So much for Ludvig
von Bayern, who in his youth was beautiful enough to
demand from the very canvas absolution for all his
vanities. As for poor Otto—recall all you know of the
Duc de Reichstadt—I mean the young man of history,
not of fiction.”</p>

<p>Fessenden rose and thrust his hands into his pockets,
staring at the ground. In a moment he raised his head
and made the motion of flinging a load from his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Is that all that has worried you?” asked Alexandra
curiously.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, “that is all.”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">XVIII</h3>
</div>

<p>A few moments later a lackey informed them that her
Royal Highness had finished her letters, and they went
up to the private apartments of the Archduchess. She
received them in the writing-room, the first of the suite,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
whose windows looked down upon Pest only. It had
been panelled and hung with blue brocade, almost as
bright as the cornflower, and the furniture and woodwork
were white and silver. It was handsome and
stately and stiff.</p>

<p>Fessenden wandered about for a time looking at the
miniatures; the Archduchess, apparently in her most
gracious mood, and somewhat amused withal, moving
beside him and giving him little biographical notes.
There was one of Maria Theresia before the flesh rolled
out, and the face and poise of head were full of young
pride and indomitable will; but this artist, like his fellows,
had failed to demonstrate the beauty with which
the historian accredits her. Several of the men and
women had the terrible Hapsburg mouth, but their eyes
were genial, and they looked like kindly simple folk.
Most of the Bavarians had some degree of beauty, although
the young women all wore that meekness of
expression which would seem to be the pertainment of
the inconspicuous females of reigning houses. The
lovely face of Elizabeth, with its strange and disconcerting
shadow of perpetual girlhood, looked from several of
the bits of porcelain and ivory. There were two of Ranata
herself, one in haughty profile, the other with eyes
cast down, but, by cunning art, suggesting a swift uplifting
of lash and a blaze beneath. The bosom also
looked about to heave, the throat to swell. The artist
evidently had caught her in some mood of self-repression
and penetrated the mask she wore so well. Fessenden
studied it for a moment in silence, then turned and
looked at her sharply. Again the subtle delight of being
understood stirred in Ranata, who had yet to learn
that the truly masculine man never understands a
woman, and has only a fleeting desire to do so when
anxious or uncomfortable. She colored slightly and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
turned her head away. Its movement happened to
be in the direction of the door leading into the sitting-room.
Fessenden’s eyes followed here, and he gave an
exclamation of rapture.</p>

<p>“Do I see a rocking-chair?” he exclaimed—“a rocking-chair?”</p>

<p>Ranata experienced the first pang of her new condition;
but deep among the complexities of her womanhood
was that indulgence for man which carries so
many of her sex through the shoals of amazement, disappointment,
and weariness, into the calm waters of
philosophy. To this instinct, as much as to pride,
might be attributed her ready words and hospitable smile.</p>

<p>“I suppose it is many weeks now since you have seen
one—unless you have happened to notice Sarolta’s?
This is Alexandra’s most cherished possession, but I am
sure she will lend it to you for a few moments.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” quoth Alexandra. “I will write a
note here, if I may.”</p>

<p>Fessenden started for the rocking-chair, but branched
abruptly to the window. “Ah!” he exclaimed, “it is
finer from here than from the garden—there are too
many trees there. The Margarenthen-Insel looks as
frivolous and unhistoried as any pleasure island in
America, and that downward sweep of the mountain is
very like the Adirondacks.”</p>

<p>“Are Americans disappointed when they find the incomparable
in Europe?” demanded the Archduchess
dryly. “I asked a lady of one of your Embassies once
how she liked Vienna, and she said she liked it very
much, but she did so miss her back-yard.”</p>

<p>Fessenden laughed heartily. “Doubtless her husband’s
post was a Christmas present from an appreciative
President. You know something of our politics,
so I need not explain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>It might be said of Ranata that she paraphrased a
famous saying of Mark Twain’s and had adopted the
version as her safeguard: “When in doubt talk politics.”
She stood beside Fessenden and regarded him with contemplative
admiration. “You have done so much,”
she said, as if considering. “Why do not you give your
country a new code of political morals?”</p>

<p>“The pigeon-holes of my country are stuffed with
codes of regeneration. The United States must dree its
weird, and suffer the penalty of springing full grown
from the brain of the old civilization. Several things
may happen, however, before she is many years older:
a revolution, which will let out the bad blood and bring
what best elements are left to the surface; a collapse of
our worst institutions through sheer rottenness; or a sudden
awakening of the public conscience. That may happen
at any moment, for all our history has proved that
you can try an American so far and no farther. The
sensationalism of the press has accustomed them to almost
anything, from daily lynchings to the unblushing
politics of their Presidents; but there is always the last
straw, and I await the falling of that straw with considerable
hope. I no longer remonstrate; on the contrary,
I give a helpful shove whenever I can do so unobserved—and
I have my men in Congress and State legislatures.
They may not be first-class men, but they are intelligent,
and they obey my orders.”</p>

<p>“You are a bit of a Jesuit.”</p>

<p>“It is a valuable lesson I have learned in your Europe.
Besides, I want the crisis to come in my best years.
Even my father could not grapple with it now; and as
this crisis was what I was born for and raised for, you
will admit that it is my duty to use every faculty and
whatever methods the peculiarities of my country demand.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>“We are not the only ones who think ourselves heaven-born,”
murmured Ranata.</p>

<p>“True, but your inspiration and mine spring from
sources as asunder as the poles. A fool ascends a throne,
with no more than enough wit to sign his name, with not
an impulse for progression, not an idea with which to
keep his state abreast of the other great nations of the
earth, with perhaps every folly that will scuttle her unless
a revolution or Heaven intervenes; and yet there he
is, half his length above other men, braver, infinitely
more intelligent men, who accept him without protest and
never forget to flatter. His masses endure him without
question, unless he push them to extremity, and often
then. Can you wonder that he believes the Almighty
placed him on that throne for some inscrutable purpose,
or that his people believe it, knowing that they would
have selected almost any one else? With us a man
blunders along through square holes and round holes
until he finds the one that fits him, and then he settles
down and attends to business. I had the superior advantage
of being trained for a specific purpose by one of
the most remarkable men living, and I have inherited
enough of him to make the consummation possible. I
‘found myself’ earlier than most men do, and I have
been finishing my education ever since. I know where
I stand and what I can do. My final accomplishment,
of course, depends entirely upon circumstances. My
best effort now is to make myself ready to meet any contingency
whatever, and to leap swiftly to its mastery.”</p>

<p>Ranata turned her head and regarded him intently.
“If I did not know you so well through my intimacy
with Alexandra,” she said, “I should find it difficult to
believe that patriotism with you was a consuming passion.
You have so much carelessness, boyishness, in
your manner—and—you are so practical!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>“If I tore about like a raging bull I might accomplish
notoriety, but I certainly should accomplish nothing
else. And the secret of the failure of the ‘reformers’ of
the United States is that they have the ideals and the
political bosses have the sense.”</p>

<p>She asked irresistibly, “If it ever came to a choice
between your country and a woman, what would be the
result?”</p>

<p>“No such question will ever arise.”</p>

<p>“No?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not. Do you think so meanly of my resources
as that?”</p>

<p>“But circumstances are sometimes stronger than
men.”</p>

<p>“Some men.”</p>

<p>Ranata had let her arm drop to her side; her hand was
not an inch from Fessenden’s. Both were acutely
aware of the magnetic temptation of that nearness; for
a second all their being seemed to have surged into
their finger-tips. Fessenden’s curved rigidly inward.
His brain was still in control, and he was accustomed to
play a careful and far-seeing game. Her hand fluttered
towards his; then she swung about abruptly.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you sit in your rocking-chair?” she asked
with a nervous laugh. “I must turn you out directly;
it is nearly time to dress.”</p>

<p>Fessenden marched to the chair, and rocked himself
for twenty minutes with every appearance of content.
Alexandra came in from the next room, and they talked
of the ball of the following night and of other impersonal
things. The peasants had come and were
housed, and a remarkable band of gypsies had been
found in Transylvania. Fessenden, who was dining in
Pest, rose regretfully at seven.</p>

<p>He smiled down upon Ranata and shook her hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
slightly. “Can I come up here again?” he asked. “I
like it much better than any other part of the palace.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said Ranata, smiling, but angry at the
quick response within her to the warm and personal
attitude of the lordly male. “You have had your own
way too much. I think you need disciplining.”</p>

<p>Alexandra was retiring through the outer room. Fessenden
raised the hand he held and pressed his lips to it
twice quickly. “I am humblest of your slaves,” he said
unsteadily.</p>

<p>“No you are not!” replied Ranata almost as unsteadily.
“And I wish you would go. I have never been
late for dinner in my life.”</p>

<p>When she was alone she turned her eyes to the rocking-chair;
then, after a manifest effort in another direction,
she moved slowly towards it, regarded it impatiently,
tenderly, then sank slowly into its embrace and dropped
her head against the cushion.</p>

<p>The palace at Buda to-day (restored by Maria Theresia)
is chiefly remarkable for the imposing beauty of
its exterior; within, the severe elegance of its walls and
furniture conveys not a hint of the ornate luxury, the
gorgeous magnificence of the palace of the fifteenth century,
during the reign of Matthias Corvinus, son of John
Hunyadi, the period in which Hungary commanded the
admiration and homage of Europe.</p>

<p>Not content with the reputation of a soldier second
only to that of his great father, Matthias, ascending the
throne at the age of fifteen, and giving immediate evidence
of intellectual and governing qualities of a rare
precocity and order, quickly ripened into a scholar and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
the most liberal patron of the arts in the world of his
day. This great and singular man, who on the battle-field
endured the hardships of the meanest of his soldiers;
who, disguised, entered the camp of his enemies
again and again, or calmly took his observations amid
a rain of bullets and spears, whose justice passed into
a proverb, and who was a rigorous administrator of
finance, had a love of luxury, matched by no contemporary,
that would have sapped the energies of another man,
and a delight in purely intellectual pursuits and discussions
that rounded one of the most versatile and grandly
equipped characters known to history. He established
and personally disciplined a body of foot soldiers—the
Black Troop—modelled upon and equal to the
famous Janissaries of Turkey, conquered the Czechs,
and captured Vienna, driving out Frederick, the German
Emperor, forcing him to take refuge in a wagon
drawn by oxen, and to beg from convent to monastery
like any common mendicant. The court of this ardent
soldier became the rallying-ground of scholars and artists,
who not only lived on his bounty, but were raised
to the highest positions in the royal household. He
spent his hours of leisure in day-long arguments with
the scientists and savants who had deserted all other
courts for this most enlightened and fascinating of monarchs,
or lying at ease on a couch covered with a golden
tapestry embroidered with pearls, in one of the most
splendid libraries that any mortal has ever possessed.
This library, sacked with the rest of the palace by the
Turks after the battle of Mohács, was contained in two
immense rooms, whose walls were covered with carved
shelves of precious woods and tapestries of velvet embroidered
with gold. The books, collected by Matthias,
and in many cases written for him, numbered ten thousand.
They were inscribed on white vellum, illuminated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
by the most accomplished masters of the art, and bound
in colored skins set with precious and semi-precious
stones. On the cover of each volume was a miniature
of Matthias and his coat-of-arms. The furnishings of
the Palace of Buda, its objects of art, many made from
gold or silver and of a great size, the tapestries, the pleasure-rooms,
the hanging gardens of his several palaces,
were marvels of beauty and costliness; and the embassies
which he constantly sent to the various courts of
Europe so surpassed the efforts of other monarchs in
extravagance that his resources of wealth alone struck
despair to the hearts of those who may have meditated
an assault upon his kingdom. When about to take a
second wife, Beatrice, daughter of the King of Naples,
the splendors and luxuries of Buda were augmented two-fold;
and on the day of the wedding the great hall of the
palace, in addition to its silken hangings interwoven
with gold and precious stones, its tapestry of sheer gold,
its thousand vessels of silver, its golden service chased
with the history of the world, silver casks of wine were
suspended from the ceiling, and a huge silver fountain
spouted the choicest and costliest of all wines, the Tokay
of Hungary.</p>

<p>The manuscripts in their jewelled cases, the thousand
objects of barbaric magnificence, were gone forever.
There was no modern art that could simulate them,
even could craftsmen be found with patience for the attempt;
but Ranata had persuaded the Emperor to send
to Buda some twenty of the superfluous Gobelins which
the Hapsburgs have retained throughout their vicissitudes.
Her argument had enlivened the mood of her
father, and raised still higher his hope in his youngest
born.</p>

<p>“The Hungarians,” Ranata had written, “no doubt
resent the very obvious fact that there are so few treasures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
in the Palace of Buda, and, knowing that our tapestries
are packed away in large numbers, and are as
priceless as they are beautiful, must infer that we fear
to trust them in this most precarious of our possessions.
So it has seemed to me that it would be another stroke
of diplomacy to send several of the best, with the understanding
that they are to remain here. It is a small yet
impressive sum to stake as an expression of our confidence
in ourselves and our Hungarian subjects.”</p>

<p>The tapestries had been promptly despatched, and
now hung in the four circle rooms opening into the Great
Hall of Ceremonies, and in the blue drawing-room and
adjacent dining-room. These rooms, as well as the long
suite down the front of the palace, were recalled for the
night of the ball from their arctic splendors by a lavish
adornment of palms and flowers, and in several of the
smaller rooms the lights were pink. Modern as it was,
the Great Hall itself, with its panels, like lakes of liquid
gold, its heavy incrustations of yellow bronze on the
brilliant white of the wood, and its immense chandeliers,
with their thousand points of light, was too perfect in
its way to gain aught from the past, nor did Ranata add
so much as a flower.</p>

<p>It had been decided that Prince Árpád Nadasdy, an
aged magnate and close friend of the Emperor, should
wear the royal robes of Matthias, as neither political nor
sentimental significance could be attached to his impersonation.
The old Prince was far closer upon senility
than his king would ever be, and addicted to long nights
of Csendes, at the Nemzesi Casino, the club of the magnates,
where he had left all of a once large income not
absorbed by the turf; but he had ordered his costume
of a long-suffering tailor, and vowed, over the hand of
his beloved princess, that he would give the final touch
of reality to the scene. As Matthias had died in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
prime, and was possessed of a classic beauty, Prince
Nadasdy, who did not number vanity among his vices,
had announced his intention to wear a flowing fair wig
and a beard, although the fine outline of Matthias had
been shaved on the battle-field. The piercing glance of
that monarch no art could coax into the bleared orbs of
the old magnate, but he still had a figure of majestic
height and carriage, and in spite of dissipations he had
preserved its slimness. He was to wait at the upper
end of the Throne Room until Ranata, who was to impersonate
Beatrice of Naples, dressed for the first time
in the national costume of her lord, should have made,
in her own character, the perfunctory round of greeting
among her assembled guests. He would then stand at
her side at the lower end of the hall while the peasants
danced the Chardash, and afterwards walk with her
through a <i>quadrille d’honneur</i>.</p>

<p>At nine o’clock on the night of the ball the great company
was assembled in the Hall of Ceremonies awaiting
the entrance of the court, but the aged Matthias had not
made his appearance. In that splendid scene, however,
he was not missed, and every eye turned constantly
towards the door beyond the second circle-room which
led to the private apartments of the Archduchess. Many
had not yet seen her, or but in glimpses, and by this
time curiosity had risen to fever pitch. The women as
well as the men were in the eccentric splendor of their
national dress, and although it varied little in cut, fancy
and extravagance prevailed in the materials of the low
bodice, the apron, and the voluminous skirts; and bodice,
neck, and arms were almost obliterated by the big
dull uncut jewels and heavy chains which, with the ancient
costumes of velvet and satin, embroidered and
brocaded with a lost art, neither time nor poverty has
been able to drive from the chest of the Hungarian.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
The magnates wore, although lightly, their velvet cloaks,
fur-lined, embroidered with jewels, and carried their
plumed kalpags in one hand.</p>

<p>The men distinguished in art and letters, without
jewels or hereditary costume, still made a fine showing
in the silk-and-velvet dress of the retainers of the court
of Matthias, but the greater number of the deputies, in
their fierce Hungarian pride, had chosen to wear the
military uniform of that period, which included a short
braided jacket and a velvet cloak of some brilliant color.</p>

<p>The young girls, although in attire less imposing than
that of their mothers and married sisters, were quite as
picturesque, and their white gowns rested the eye in
that blaze of color. Each house had contributed a
young son who wore the purple velvet, the golden chain,
and the golden network on their heads of the ambassadorial
youths of King Matthias. These pages stood
in a double file along the two circle rooms leading to the
apartments of the Archduchess. In the high gallery
that traverses the hall a military band played softly.
Beneath, in the arcade, a double gypsy band awaited
their turn and eagerly observed the historic scene. Behind
them, erect against the wall, as dignified and impressive
as the greatest of the nobles, were the peasants
who were to dance the Chardash. Their presence was
a surprise to all, and they had inspired almost as much
conversation as the royal hostess herself.</p>

<p>That conversation was very animated, at times quite
shrill, for the Hungarians, as lively by temperament as
the American, were more excited to-night than they had
been during the visit of William of Germany. The excitement
during his entertainment had been, with slight
exception, confined to the men, but there was not a
woman in the palace to-night who did not feel a flutter
at her heart and a shortening of her breath. Not only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
was Ranata is appearance and manner their ideal of
what a princess should be, and the daughter of a queen
and the sister of a prince they had worshipped, but they
stood in expectation of the initial moment of a court
life which promised to be more brilliant than anything
in Europe, might indeed revive the gay splendors of the
days when their fathers had been the greatest aristocracy
in the world—when the Hapsburgs were robber
barons and the Hohenzollerns unknown. That this
should be given to them who had been starved of court
life, that those who were too impoverished to leave their
entailed homes and go to Vienna should now cherish
the prospect of constant functions, and many private
entertainments in the palace, filled every feminine heart
with a sense of enchantment, and gratitude to this fairy
princess who had dared to have an idea. They were
prepared to love as much as they admired her, and jealousy
had entered few souls, in spite of the extravagant
admiration of the men. Many of the women, indeed,
were beautiful enough to spare themselves envy, and
those who were neither handsome, nor yet pretty, had
sufficient cleverness and animation to keep their little
courts together.</p>

<p>Alexandra had decided not to enter in Ranata’s wake.
Having none of that unwisdom which permits a wound
to self-love that a grievance may be nursed afterwards,
nor yet affinity for the rôle of the humble follower, she
was always careful not to be placed in any position by
her exalted friend that might rankle too late in her brain.
She had, therefore, entered the room early, under the
chaperonage of Princess Nadasdy, and Zrinyi, as ever,
hovered close. He was a beautiful object in his thick
gold embroideries, his plum-colored velvet cloak, his
buttons and his chains; and Alexandra, in the dull-rose
costume with its old-lace veil and apron, lent her by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
ambitious Zápolya, excited his approval to such a degree
that once more he poured his impassioned avowal
into her ears, and begged her to accept the chests of
his grandmother as well as himself.</p>

<p>“Are they at your castle in the Alps?” asked Alexandra.
“How can I decide such a question when I do
not yet know whether that castle is sufficiently romantic
to meet my most exacting taste? Like all
Americans, Count, I am a connoisseur in castles; and
how can I be sure that your grandmother’s clothes will
fit? Besides, I am a monomaniac on the subject of
microbes.”</p>

<p>Zrinyi, if he did not yet understand her, was by this
time sufficiently seasoned to accept her sallies with
neither sulks nor despair. Perceiving that she was in a
frivolous mood he changed the subject.</p>

<p>“Are you not glad to be here to-night?” he demanded.
“To play a part? Who knows what may be the result of
the extraordinary impression the Princess has made? I
feel that to-night she will either make a—a—portentous
impression or disillusionize us altogether.”</p>

<p>“Great moment in the history of Hungary?” asked
Alexandra mischievously.</p>

<p>The Count flushed, but laughed. “Yes,” he said defiantly.
“I seldom have presentiments, but when I do—I
shall not give you another chance to laugh at me.
I do not see Mr. Abbott. Was he not to come with
Prince Nadasdy? I hope nothing has happened to our
king of to-night. He was not very sober last evening
at the club. I have not seen him to-day, and hoped he
was in bed building himself up for the ordeal.”</p>

<p>“I have not seen my brother since yesterday—he sent
word this morning he could not come to tea; but I know
of no one so well able to take care of himself. Still I
am surprised, for he should be here before the Princess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
enters. Even he would hardly dare to arrive afterwards.
Have you seen him?”</p>

<p>“Only this morning in the park, where I happened to
be rather early. Perhaps he went off for a day in the
country; I fancy he is tired of being stared at. He excites
as much attention as the Princess, and he told me
last night that he is persecuted by all sorts of men with
business schemes, to say nothing of those who expect
him to instruct them in the art of getting rich. I find
something picturesque myself about his unimaginable
wealth, combined with the fact that he is a gentleman
and young; but I admire more his achievements, and I
am very proud to be one of the many to do him honor in
Hungary.”</p>

<p>Then Alexandra gave him a dazzling smile, and
moved a step closer. “You are so much more sensible
than you were!” she whispered. “I feel as if you owed
as much to me as to your mother. Who knows what
may happen if you continue to improve?”</p>

<p>“I know that American girls say things that in any
other women would indicate a small amount of heart
and soul. It is safe to assume that you mean nothing
you say.”</p>

<p>“Think of the reserve force, lacking in your emotional
woman! I may not give much at a time when I marry,
but I shall have enough left to spread over a lifetime.”</p>

<p>He laughed. “At least I don’t delude myself that you
are a poet in disguise. Well, I only ask that you marry
me and let me begin your education. You may also
continue mine.”</p>

<p>“You really are improving—” began Alexandra, when
with the rest of the company she fell silent. The staff
of the Grand Chamberlain smote the floor three times.</p>

<p>The doors of the private apartments opened, and the
officers of the court appeared, walking backward. As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
there was no throne, they took up their position on either
side of the entrance to the Hall of Ceremonies. And
then Ranata entered.</p>

<p>She entered alone, although her ladies followed a
moment later. As she walked slowly down the two
circle rooms, empty but for the pages, the great company,
in curious excitement, which they attributed afterwards
to the complete illusion she produced, thronged
towards the entrance of the hall, breathing shortly and
crowding each other without ceremony.</p>

<p>Her appearance and her solitary progress between the
ranks of bowing pages in their rich mediæval costumes,
was as startling in its historic naturalness as in its stately
and picturesque beauty. The full skirts of her gown
were of a material so fine as to be almost invisible, covered
with embroidery in pearls and silver thread, and
flounces of point-lace. The bodice, sloping outward
from waist-line to shoulders, was of pale blue velvet, half
covered with lace, and roped together across the black
tulle of the under-bodice with strands of large pearls.
The court train of blue velvet was lined with lace instead
of ermine—thus increasing the ethereal effect of the
whole costume—and embroidered with black ravens
holding a golden ring in the beak—the emblem of John
Hunyadi. Her hair fell to her knees in thick ropes wound
about with strands of pearls, two traversing the front
of her figure, the rest half hidden by the veil which hung
from a tiara almost as high as the Pope’s. On her neck
and arms were many pearls. The brilliant fairness of
her skin, the flaming copper of her hair, the intense
blackness of her brows and lashes, the regularity of her
features, and the majestic beauty of her figure, combined
with her royal state, the enchantment of her condescension
as a daughter of the coldest house in Europe,
and her bewildering presentment of the daughter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
of the Anjous, induced one moment of silence so profound
that it was almost hysterical. Then Zrinyi lifted
his kalpag and cried “<i>Élyen!</i>” and in another moment
the vast company, from Prince Illehazy, most dignified
of magnates, to the most truculent deputy in the room,
were stamping their feet and shouting “<i>Élyen!</i>” until
the chandeliers trembled, and their lights were reflected
in the jewels on the waving kalpags. Even the peasants
and gypsies forgot their humble rôle and broke in
with abrupt discordant cries, the Roumanians shouting
“<i>Setreasca!</i>” And then all united in one great
“<i>Vivat!</i>” It was a tribute as portentous as it was spontaneous,
for it had been accomplished by the art without
words.</p>

<p>For an instant Ranata felt a sensation of tumultuous
faintness, but she walked on slowly, not relaxing the
mask of her face, except for a graceful smile of acknowledgment.
Then she was possessed by an exhilaration
which sent the blood through her veins like spirits, and
in her brain was a confusion of feminine and patriotic
delight, insolent triumph over the man who had worked
harder than she to make these walls ring, and an emotional
melting towards one whose face she did not see
in that worshipping throng. It had been arranged that
the distinguished American should attend King Matthias
as captain of the “Black Troop,” and although his
place for the moment was at the head of the throne
room beside the King his height should make him noticeable
even in the confused breaking of ranks. But
Ranata’s eyes did not encounter his, and as she advanced
closer to that tossed sea of flashing eyes and shouting
voices, this daughter of the Cæsars, who had convinced
an emperor and his Metternich that she could maintain
the integrity of an empire, for a moment forgot her
great rôle and permitted her soul to murmur, “Is he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
here? Is he here? If he is, does he think me the most
beautiful woman in the world? Is he thrilled with my
triumph? Does he love me the more for it? Does he
love me at all?”</p>

<p>She had almost reached the entrance of the throne
room, and the company was moving backward to the
walls, when, through the falling wave of sound, a low
note reached her ear from a new direction. It came
from the blue drawing-room, which here opens from the
second circle-room; and although the word was merely
the one still echoing, and uttered hardly above a whisper,
it thrilled Ranata as even the fulness of her triumph
had not done. Only the self-control which the years
and her state had given her kept her eyes fixed upon
those who would note the flicker of a lash.</p>

<p>She entered the throne room, and made her tour of
the guests in what was now an atmosphere vibrating
with suppressed excitement. They held their breath
to hear her speak; and although to exchange a word with
each would have consumed the night, she paused where
she thought it judicious and said a few personal words,
while her eyes included those close by. When she
reached the end of the room she discovered that the royal
bridegroom was not at his post, and was profoundly annoyed.
She herself might be the Hamlet of the piece,
but without the chief accessory the illusion would
tremble. There was no sign of him, however, and she
could only hope that, fearing the full fatigue, he was in
the blue room with his captain.</p>

<p>She forgot him for the moment as her eye suddenly
encountered the fixed and fiery glance of Lajos Molnár.
He wore a fierce red uniform, and stood against the wall
with his arms folded. He looked as if he had been
dragged to the palace by a halter and was prepared for
the worst that could befall him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>Ranata smiled brilliantly, and motioned to him to
come forth. He obeyed with such precipitation that
there was a momentary panic in the ranks. Ranata
gave him her lifted hand, and he kissed it like any
courtier.</p>

<p>“Thank you for obeying my orders,” she said. “Have
you brought your friends?”</p>

<p>“Four,” he stammered. “The others were obdurate,
but I shall win another time. These are all men of
importance; and like myself they would die for you,
your Royal Highness!”</p>

<p>“Ah! Would you?” she asked softly. “I shall not
ask that—only that you will all come here to luncheon
to-morrow, and tell me what you think I should know.
Will you?”</p>

<p>“Yes—yes—will I?”</p>

<p>Ranata smiled again and passed on, but in truth she
was repelled at the unmasked passion in his face. It
was evident that she had succeeded too well; and, while
to fascinate him was a necessary part of her programme,
his love both disgusted and faintly alarmed her. Like
all women whose depths have been profoundly stirred
by one man, she regarded the proffered love of other men
as an insult, and was merciless.</p>

<p>When she had finished her progress amid a tribute
as expressive as its vocal prelude, she took her stand at
the end of the room; the Grand Chamberlain raised his
hand, and the leader of the gypsy bands struck his cymbal.
The peasants made their way to the middle of
the hall, and began the curious stamping march which
sometimes opens the Chardash. The company were
diverted at once. Not only was here a novelty worthy
of the night, but the peasants had been selected for
their good looks and the superior beauty and freshness
of their costumes. The men from the Hungarian villages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
had much embroidery on their white trousers and
flowing shirts, and on the wide sleeves which escaped
from jackets as elaborate in device as they were gay in
color; their slender waists were bound with the silken
sash of the gala-day, and many wore chains about their
necks. Those that had been found in Hungary’s Roumanian
villages beyond the Theiss wore the ancient
Persian sandal laced half-way to the knee, closer trousers,
and a graceful shoulder-cloak. Their women wore
panels of embroidery over white petticoats, and blouses
almost as elaborate; while the Hungarian women, if not
so richly attired, were quite as picturesque in their tight
bodices of bright cloth with full sleeves and upper
front of spotless lawn, their fancy aprons and dainty
kerchiefs. All were handsome, and some of the Roumanians
with their Roman faces and antique heads and
forms had as much beauty as falls to the lot of any mortal.
As they passed Ranata they looked their loyalty,
for they too pulsed with the popular excitement, but
they played their part with a calm self-possession which
the great hills and the lonely plains had bred in them,
and courts could do no more.</p>

<p>Ranata fixed her gaze resolutely upon them, but her
ear was strained towards the drawing-room. Why did
not the bridegroom come forth and bring the captain
in his wake? But it was not until the march was over,
and the partners were swinging about to the first slow
wail of the dance, and holding every eye, that she became
aware of the trailing of regal garments on the hard
floor behind her. Her quick ear advised her that, for
the moment at least, he was unaccompanied. She set
her face in severity, for she had no mind to let the old
Prince take his own way unreproved, and as he finally
halted beside her she did not speak nor lift her eyes to
his, although she darted a glance of feminine curiosity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
over his costume. It was regal enough; and in spite of
his age he looked a superb and supple figure in his closely
fitting armor of gold brocade sewn with jewels, covered
to the waist with chains; and his legs in their long silken
stockings were as shapely as youth. From his shoulders
flowed a mantle of white velvet lined with ermine,
and embroidered with the black raven holding the golden
circlet in its beak. In spite of her intent to reprove,
Ranata’s eye travelled upward to observe how well he
wore the crown, the while her ear was alert for another
footfall. But her ear forgot its cunning, and her eye
the crown it was rising to criticise, the while it should ignore
the bleared apologetic orbs of her father’s old friend.
Her gaze was arrested and held by the piercing glance
which tradition and the artist have given to Matthias
Corvinus. And the rest of the presentment was complete,
Ranata noted as her knees shook; even under the
fair wig and beard the outlines were firm and fine, and
the head was well poised and shaped. He looked far more
the king than her father or any other sovereign in Europe,
except perhaps the man whose memory she had
expunged to-night. Had the dead risen? As the room
swam round her she wondered if she were expected to
drop on one knee. Then the eyes puckered themselves
and smiled, and Ranata was the angriest woman in
Hungary.</p>

<p>“How dared you!” she exclaimed beneath her breath.
“How dared you!”</p>

<p>“Dared?”</p>

<p>“Yes! Yes! Yes!”</p>

<p>“It required no courage whatever, merely ingenuity—a
considerable amount of that, however. Would you
care to hear the story?”</p>

<p>“I have no curiosity on the subject whatever. Where
is Prince Nadasdy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>“At this moment? I have no idea. Yes, he is probably
at the casino—if there is any one left to play with
him. Otherwise he is doubtless lost to every variety of
disappointment.”</p>

<p>“And you—how did you inveigle that costume from
him?”</p>

<p>“Inveigle, madame? I paid a king’s ransom for this
costume.”</p>

<p>“Your loathsome American millions! I thought there
were a few things they could not accomplish.”</p>

<p>“There is nothing, madame. When they fail it is due
to bungling only.”</p>

<p>“You have no cause to be angry—to assume that tone
with me!”</p>

<p>“You have abused me like a pickpocket.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon—it seemed to me incredible that
a magnate of Hungary, a prince who has been a member
of my father’s household, should do such a thing.”</p>

<p>“When magnates and courtiers are consumed with a
passion for gambling, to say nothing of the strong wines
of Hungary, they are apt to degenerate into very ordinary
human creatures. The story is a brief one, and I
know you wish to hear it. I have had the honor of
playing a number of games of Hungarian poker with
your prince, who conceived a flattering preference for
my game, although I usually won. Three nights ago I
told him plainly that I wanted to come to this ball as
King Matthias, and wear his costume. At first he merely
stared at me helplessly; then he reflected that, being
an American, I was doubtless mad, and proceeded to
deal with me in his gentle and charming manner. When
he was convinced both of my strength of purpose and
sanity, I proposed a game in which he should stake this
costume and his silence against a sum which I will not
name. Furthermore, if I won I was to pay the price of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
the costume three times over and return it to him the
day after the ball. He confessed that he was haunted
by the fear his tailor would not hand over the outfit
without the price, and that he might have to mortgage
his family jewels to pay it. He closed with my offer in
less time than I am telling you this tale. His last scruple
was of you, for he knew that I could pass unnoticed in
the crowd, particularly if I kept my eyes half shut and
waggled my head occasionally; and I vowed to him that
I would secure your forgiveness—”</p>

<p>“I shall never forgive either of you, and I am ashamed
of him.”</p>

<p>“So am I. But one man’s loss is usually another’s
gain, and I am here without a scruple or regret.”</p>

<p>“Your horrible money may have bought poor old
Nadasdy, but it will carry you no further.”</p>

<p>Fessenden’s hand closed deliberately on hers, and he
drew it through his arm. Ranata was aghast, but it was
impossible to struggle, and she stood rigid, but closer to
him by two inches.</p>

<p>“I and the money you hate have no further dealings
with each other to-night,” he whispered. “But for
every barrier it has levelled between you and me, for
all that it has permitted me to accomplish that makes
me more worthy of you, it has my eternal gratitude.
And now, please forget it.”</p>

<p>“I can forget nothing,” she murmured. “And you
are running a terrible risk. If my father hears of this
you may be requested to leave the Empire.”</p>

<p>“May I tell you that you are looking more beautiful
than any one on earth can look?”</p>

<p>“Am I?”</p>

<p>She grasped at her receding anger, but it vanished.
Into its place flashed an enchanting sense of danger;
the wildness in her Hapsburg blood leaped its dike and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
seemed to roar in her ears the while it sang in her soul.
She forgot the years in which she had mourned the subjugation
of Rudolf’s fine brain by his passions, and the
interminable disasters his weakness had entailed. Why
should she not be thankful that her own drama had begun
at last? She should live and feel. What mattered
the end?</p>

<p>It was by no means the first time the temptation had
beset her since she had met Fessenden Abbott, but her
brain had controlled her hitherto; she had fancied that
her clear vision would keep the end always in view,
however she might feel the weakness of woman within
her and indulge it in friendship, while working for the
cause of her house. But the excitement and exhilaration
of this evening had lifted her to reckless heights, her
pulses were throbbing, her being was trembling with exaltation,
her head almost whirling. And before her was
the great company who knew nothing, suspected nothing.
To live in their very presence, as if they were ants on a
hill—her newly born dramatic sense flew to the fanning
of her emotions. She leaned heavily on his arm and
raised her eyes.</p>

<p>“Am I?” she whispered again. “I wondered—I
heard your <i>Élyen</i>.”</p>

<p>“I knew that you heard it.”</p>

<p>“I did not turn my head.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, I knew.”</p>

<p>“Can you read my soul?” she exclaimed in a momentary
panic. “Do not read too much.”</p>

<p>“That is all I live for.”</p>

<p>“You—who have so much else! Would you give up
one of your ambitions for me?”</p>

<p>“I would give up the whole game, every ambition,
every penny.”</p>

<p>“Your country?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>“Yes, my country.”</p>

<p>“You were very cool about it yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Yesterday is not to-night.”</p>

<p>“I had the greatest faith in your devotion to your
country.”</p>

<p>“When you feel as I do now you will have faith in
nothing else.”</p>

<p>“Do not be too mad. Let us be happy for this one
evening.”</p>

<p>“Is this your idea of happiness?”</p>

<p>“I am as happy as I dare to be.”</p>

<p>“When I have taught you what happiness is you will
remember this prelude as a very poor affair.”</p>

<p>“Have you also bought poor old Nadasdy’s jewels?”</p>

<p>“No, he is not so bad as that; but he is not above
renting them.”</p>

<p>“Not another magnate would speak to him again if
they knew what he had done.”</p>

<p>“They are not to know it.”</p>

<p>“Why did you wish to be king?”</p>

<p>“For two reasons: I am tired of duennas and interruptions—I
have not much patience. Matthias was the
husband of Beatrice, and you are Beatrice. In the eyes
of this fanciful company to-night you are my wife—I
am your bridegroom.”</p>

<p>He felt her tremble and draw in her breath sharply.
But in a moment she raised her eyes again—and there
was no veil upon them—and said: “Yes—I will be Beatrice
for these few hours, and believe that you are Matthias.
Is—do you mean to tell me that there is no
happiness in such imagining? If I have been happy in
my fancy before, surely this—this—”</p>

<p>Fessenden was as nearly intoxicated as a man may
be in the presence of a thousand people. “Listen to the
Chardash for a moment,” he said unsteadily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>The Chardash was near its finish. The gypsies were
playing madly. The peasants were shouting and stamping,
their women dancing with the graceful energy of
panthers; the spectators were looking on in delight, the
bodies of many swaying slightly. The music stopped
with a crash that had a note of disappointment and
anger in its triumph; the peasants marched forward and
bowed profoundly to their sovereigns—who looked as
high and impersonal, yet gracious, as sovereigns should
look—then filed out of the room, to revel in the servants’
quarters till morning.</p>

<p>The guests were impatient to dance. The musicians
in the gallery received their signal, and the opening
quadrilles were quickly formed, eight in the four circle
rooms.</p>

<p>Fessenden walked through the stately old-fashioned
quadrille very creditably. His hands were concealed in
gauntlets, and his height would have saved his face from
too close an inspection had any one felt sufficient interest
in the old Prince to examine him in detail. Once
only he caught the eye of the Countess Piroska Zápolya,
and wondered if she had recognized him. He was the
least vain of men, but she had exhibited a preference
for the distinguished young millionaire as openly as a
high-born maiden may; and the glance he encountered
to-night was less guileless, perhaps less amiable than
usual. But she left Fessenden’s mind as abruptly as she
had entered it. He was absorbed in planning an interview
alone with Ranata. He had come to the palace in
doubt as to what he should say or leave unsaid until a
future stage, but her sudden unmistakable yielding to
her emotions, if not to him, had sent the blood to his
head and spurred his will to action. He divined that
she intended to play with those emotions under the protecting
eye of the public; but while he had no mind to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
court too great temptation himself, he was determined
to seclude her long enough for a conversation which
should put an end to moods and coquetry, and compel
her to face herself and him. The quadrille finished with
a waltz, and he saw his opportunity. He put his arm
about her before she had time to retire to her former
position.</p>

<p>“Take your train over your arm,” he said, “or you will
have a circle about you as many yards deep; and I want
to be lost in the crowd.”</p>

<p>She obeyed him, and they waltzed unobserved. The
greater part of the company was dancing; the older
women, including Sarolta, had gone to the reception-rooms
to play cards or eat ices, and no one would be
surprised if the royal hostess, her part played, had
chosen to retire. It was evident that the guests were
expected to enjoy themselves; and if anything further
was necessary to add to the gay content of the evening,
it came with the rumor that immediately after supper
Count Zrinyi and Miss Abbott would lead a cotillion,
and that the favors were many and unique.</p>

<p>“This evening is ours,” said Fessenden peremptorily.
“Take me where we can talk alone for an hour.”</p>

<p>But she took alarm. “Not quite alone. On the
balcony in front of the tea-room perhaps—”</p>

<p>“A balcony, if you like, for it is too warm to think in
the palace. But not that one. You must trust me.
You will have to do so for the rest of your life, so you
may as well begin now.”</p>

<p>Ranata, having no practical knowledge of men, and
still throbbing with a reckless desire for adventure,
hesitated no longer. She had learned that this American’s
power of self-control was very great; and if he
would permit her to play with fire until the wildest in
her was exhausted, and she could feel for him again as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
she had felt in sadder hours of self-communing, why
should she fling aside an opportunity which might never
come again? He held her in a light embrace, but it
filled her with happiness and submission. She was all
woman, and the sensation intoxicated her. Let the
morrow and its cold duties take care of themselves.</p>

<p>When a woman with an uncommon power of passion
delivers herself to liberty after years of self-repression she
is more than likely to forget all she has ever considered,
and pass with blind eyes the half-way house where most
women sit down and think. Perhaps it is more correct
to say that the fire in her brain induces a sort of insanity
of which the average mortal is incapable, and in spite
of the ideals of her calmer moments and her thoughtful
programme of conduct, she is at the mercy of the man.
In this instance the man was playing a very big game;
and although Ranata was in no mood for analysis,
instinct told her that he was the one man who had ever
loved her with whom she could trust herself.</p>

<p>They were in the circle-room from which her apartments
opened. It was not wise to enter directly. She
pushed aside a tapestry on the left, and when it fell they
were in a corridor. It was deserted and she led him
through unlighted rooms and into her suite by the door
which the King had used when the Queen came to Buda.
Here the lights burned dimly, but she did not pause
until they were on the balcony. The moon was too
young to reveal them to any one below; but a woman
who has been severely chaperoned will sit out all night
with a man and shrink from the indelicacy of screening
walls.</p>

<p>Ranata sank hurriedly into a chair and motioned
Fessenden to one opposite; but he shook his head and
stood looking down upon her for a moment without
speaking. He had left his beard and wig and crown in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
the sitting-room, and in that superb costume under the
light of moon and stars he looked not unlike Matthias,
and handsomer than himself had ever looked before. His
beauty was the last thing that concerned him, but he saw
the sudden rise of Ranata’s bosom under the tight bodice,
and the flash in her eyes as she dropped them. He did
not comprehend the cause, but he tingled in response and
almost yielded to an impulse to kneel beside her and take
her in his arms. But there was too much to say, and he
drew back. If he kissed her now he should have to talk
to her another time, and opportunities were too rare.</p>

<p>“Let us thresh it out,” he said. “I want to marry
you. You have a hundred reasons against it, of course.
They never will mean anything to me; but if you want
to relieve your mind I am ready to hear and answer them.”</p>

<p>She had put out her hands in deprecation. “Don’t
be so practical to-night! We could write all that if
must be said. To-night we were to play a game—I
am Beatrice—you are Matthias.”</p>

<p>“Not here. That sort of thing is for a ballroom flirtation,
or for lengths which you probably don’t understand.
I am up to no such pretty comedy here alone
with you; besides, I am in no mood for the unreal, no
matter how pleasant it might be. This is a matter
of eternity with me. I have never loved any woman
before, and I have never wanted anything I have fought
for with my life in my hand as I want you. These are
the first moments I have actually felt the reality of life.
It has been a game before. I know now I could have
relinquished that game at any moment for something
else, with no very deep pang. But I could no more give
you up than I could live without my head. And I
have no intention of trying. I shall marry you, but
whether it is to be the most difficult job of my life
or not depends entirely upon you. You love me, and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
am romantic enough to believe that every man has his
mate in this world, and that you are mine; but your
head is full of absurd notions that you will have forgotten
after a year in the United States.”</p>

<p>She stood up then, the princess again for a moment.
“Oh!” she exclaimed. “Remember that Europe is still
a reality; that, so long as the United States permits it to
exist on the map, its prejudices and customs are entitled
to respect.”</p>

<p>“I am ready to respect your prejudices, but as I am
not a European I am not obliged to accept them as final.”</p>

<p>“Is it possible,” she asked, staring at him, “that you
do not know we never could marry?”</p>

<p>“Only if every clergyman on the planet refused to
perform the ceremony. Have you not, with that fine
brain of yours, thought deeply enough to know that
nothing is impossible? I could have told myself that a
hundred things were impossible, and be a nonentity
to-day. Marriage between a man and woman who are
free is the least of the impossibilities.”</p>

<p>“But, great Heaven!—cannot you understand?—I am
the daughter of the Emperor of Austria!”</p>

<p>“You are not any other man’s wife. That is all that
concerns me.”</p>

<p>“Do you realize what it would mean to Europe, to
the principle of monarchy, if I, an archduchess of
Austria, married an American?”</p>

<p>“Do you imagine that I am interested in perpetuating
the monarchical idea?”</p>

<p>“But I am—at all events, I, as a part of it, know where
my duty lies; and—will you consider my mission here?”</p>

<p>“Your mission here is the impossible one of preserving
the integrity of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy.
Western Austria will melt towards the German Empire
by a natural law; and as for Hungary, cannot you see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
that the destiny of this people is independence? They
would accept you as a welcome substitute for Franz
Ferdinand, but only until they were ready to face Europe
as an independent state. Do you suppose that the
sole destiny of the United States is to live and prosper?
Every day envy of her grows in the European, ridden
by police, his individuality cramped by social laws, his
manhood dwarfed by a ridiculous institution that should
have disappeared with the first year of free schools.
Monarchy was necessary enough in its time, but its
time is past. All educated mankind is determined upon
freedom. William of Germany will not admit it, but his
mission is to sweep the kinglets of Europe off the board
and unite their states into a peaceful whole which shall
convert itself at the right moment into another great
republic founded on the few sound principles of socialism.
Man’s destiny has steadily progressed towards independence
since the beginning of general education,
and the time is almost ripe for the fulfilment of it. That
is the reason, quite aside from friendship, that I shall give
my assistance to William the moment he is ready for it.
He pretends not to believe that the result must be a republic,
but in the depths of his great intelligence he must.”</p>

<p>Now was the moment for acting, to promise anything
if he would desert William. But the thought passed
through her mind and out. That might have been
possible yesterday, but not to-night; might indeed have
been possible an hour earlier, but not now. She too
was facing the bald realities; and the chiefest was that
her love for this man, at whom she seemed to stare
through a mountain, was eternal; and that she could
take no advantage of his love for her, even were there
anything else that mattered.</p>

<p>As she stood and looked at him, her eyes stony, her
face set in despair, Fessenden for the first time felt his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
courage recede. Her next words left him for a few
moments without speech, and with the sensation that
the world had come suddenly to an end.</p>

<p>“Then,” she said, “I must work out my destiny with
my house. If it is tottering, then the severer my duty
to stand by it till it falls. What happiness could I
have?—what a picture!—I secure in America, and all
my kind groaning under the ruins of Europe? I believe
that what you predict has reason enough. I am no
infatuated monarchist. I have known Alexandra too
long for that. And I have never doubted the fate of
Austria since Rudolf’s death. There is no reason why
the rest of Europe should not follow. But it will not come
in a moment, and it is the bare duty of every man and
woman of royal birth to give to the old idea their last
drop of heart’s blood and life-blood, whether there is
any individual achievement for them or not. As for me,
if I were convinced—which I am not—that I could do
no good by making Hungary mine, still would I remain
at my post. It will break my heart; it will make life a
mere tread-mill, now that I have known you; but if you
kidnapped me I should return.”</p>

<p>They faced each other then for two or three minutes
without speaking; but although Fessenden could descend
into depths of discouragement, nothing this side
of death could keep him there. The army of resources
in his soul stirred in their nap—it was seldom they slept—and
quickened his blood in the old lust of the fight.
He revolted with angry impatience against his momentary
despair; and at the same time realized that this, the
supreme desire of his life, he would not have won with
no exercise of the talents which had been given him that
he might wear down and ride down the obstacles of life.</p>

<p>“Very well,” he said, “your way of looking at things
is natural enough; but I don’t want you to forget for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
one moment that, deeply as I respect even your prejudices,
they mean nothing to me intellectually, and
never can influence my conduct in the least. But on
this subject I will say no more now except that your
argument that you should stand by your house until
it falls is too illogical to be worthy of you. It is not a
woman’s part in life to prop up rotten structures, but to
assist man in founding new ones to replace the old; nor
is it the highest destiny of human beings to retrograde
or stand still, but to progress. And if I regard the past
with its superstitions and institutions as mere history,
as a mere prelude to a far greater present, and if I myself
belong to that present and to the future, you by no
means are an indissoluble part of the past. You are too
virile, too healthy, too modern, too great in every part
of your equipment; you represent the utmost that Europe
and her centuries have been able to make of your
sex; and if she had any design in making you, it was as
a present to the future, not as a sacrifice to the past.
But enough. I have a plan to propose. For two months
we will not speak of this. Nurse your traditions if you
like, believe that we must part, but make up your mind
to be happy during this time. We will have constant
companionship and some moments alone.”</p>

<p>The light broke through her face again, and she held
out her hands. “Yes! Yes!” she exclaimed. “A fool’s
paradise! That is what I would have asked. It is all
I can ever know, and it will give me courage for the rest
of my life. But I was afraid—I was afraid— It is a
very unpractical plan for you to suggest.”</p>

<p>“I have my unpractical moments,” said Fessenden,
“and this is one of them.” And then he caught her in
his arms and kissed her, while the music of the Chardash
from the palace and the Danube beat upon them; and
something of the dearest dream of both was realized.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>But he left her presently. As he closed behind him
the door by which he had entered the private apartments,
he had a flashing glimpse of a face he knew; but the
blood was in his head, and the small white visage, disappearing
like a ghost’s, made no impression on him—he
did not even recall it in cooler moments. He had readjusted
his disguise, and he made his way down the great
staircase, exciting no more comment than would have
fallen to the portion of Prince Nadasdy, who certainly
would be expected to go home early. When he reached
the palace of the old Prince he changed his gorgeous
trappings for the inconspicuous tweeds he had left there,
and then went out and walked until dawn. When he returned
to his hotel he wrote two letters, one to his father,
and one to his friend in Berlin. The latter concluded as
follows: “... But not for two months, or thereabouts.
I want her to have a deep draught of this Hungarian
wine she finds so heady, that she may have the less to
torment her imagination with in the future. Moreover,
I want that much time to teach her that she really loves
me. If we acted too promptly, she might, during the
inevitable weeks, perhaps months, of separation, persuade
herself that it had been but a passing madness.
And I want her to be in no doubt during that time of
what her rewards will be.”</p>

<p>“I can safely count on help there,” thought Fessenden,
as he enclosed the letter in a second envelope addressed
to a less conspicuous name, “for before these two months
have passed he will be as anxious to see her in America
as I am.”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">XX</h3>
</div>

<p>At luncheon that afternoon Fessenden found himself
beside the Countess Piroska. The Archduchess had an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
Independent on either hand, and Alexandra assisted her
with one of them. The Countess Vilma had another in
charge. There were no other guests, and Sarolta, who
had found the prospect of Radical politicians anything
but amusing, was lunching elsewhere. The table had
been laid in the small dining-room adjoining the blue
room, but the curtains were half drawn across the large
windows, for all the women were paler than usual.
Three had danced until the cocks of Buda announced
the morning, and the other had slept less than they.
She and Fessenden had met without a word, but with a
handshake of complete understanding. The “Young
Kossuths” were in good order; they had left the ball as
soon as the general dancing began. As they entered
to-day they had looked somewhat truculent, as if fearful
of patronage, but were now at their ease, and Molnár
alone appeared indifferent to the delicate viands of the
palace chefs.</p>

<p>“He is in love with our princess,” whispered Piroska
scornfully. “Not but that it is quite natural everybody
should fall in love with her, but I should think it would
be a sensation to be avoided by any one under an archduke;
and as for Molnár, he is not to be pitied, he is too
ludicrous.”</p>

<p>“I don’t fancy you waste much pity on any one,”
said Fessenden.</p>

<p>“I pity you,” said Piroska softly.</p>

<p>“Indeed?” he asked innocently. “What have I done
that I should be pitied?”</p>

<p>“Done? Ah—but I understand American better
since I have had the pleasure to know Miss Abbott. I
mean—I think you are too fine to waste your love on a
woman who is no more achievable than the polar star.”</p>

<p>“Oh— Do you think I am in love with the Archduchess?
Well, I will confide to you that I am, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
don’t—don’t betray me, or the Emperor will be ordering
me out of the Dual Monarchy; and I have a theory that
it is a good thing for a young man to be in love with the
polar star. It keeps him out of much mischief.”</p>

<p>Piroska was nonplussed, and turned her wide gaze
upon him. He was eating with every appearance of
appetite, and Piroska, although a sordid soul, had her
idea of what a lover should be.</p>

<p>“You never have eyes for any one else,” she murmured,
at a loss.</p>

<p>“Remember the limited time at my disposal. One
month—two, perhaps, and I must walk a tread-mill in a
land without polar stars.” He was thinking, “Shall I
throw her off the track, or would she be more useful as
an enemy? I should use her without scruple, for I
am convinced that she is here to spy, and she has a
ledger where her heart ought to be. It will not do to
be too precipitate; she might act before we are ready.
All I want is her added weight at the right moment.”
He determined to be guided by events, and turned to
her with his frank smile, which seemed at once to establish
a personal relation. “I should like to show you
America—that is a large order!—New York, rather,” he
said. “You must come over some time with my sister.”
And then, to the mystified but delighted little <i>intrigante</i>,
he made himself as agreeable for the next
half-hour as he knew how; and his spirits were so plainly
unaffected that the Zápolya thought less of Ranata’s
power to charm.</p>

<p>The rising voice of Molnár gave him the excuse he
wanted to assist the Archduchess in her difficult task.</p>

<p>“You are all so tired,” he murmured to Piroska. “I
had better talk to that man.”</p>

<p>“The King is quite mistaken,” Molnár was announcing,
“if he believes that our ultimate idea in wishing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
the universal use of the Magyar language in our own
country is to divide the army against itself, or to encourage
hatred towards Austria. Not only does the
Constitution accepted by the King provide that Hungarian
soldiers shall be commanded by Hungarian officers,
but we wish the language for two reasons—to fulfil
more nearly a passionate national ideal, and because it
is the fitting reward of a thousand years of indomitable
individuality.”</p>

<p>“But do you not think,” asked Fessenden, “that passionate
ideals, when carried to extreme, may degenerate
into mere vanity? I suppose you are not averse
from a fair-minded discussion, so you will not mind my
saying that I think vanity is the only rock on which
the Hungarian nation may split and go to pieces. It
is a dominant trait in your aristocracy, as is evidenced
by their theatrical and childish delight in an ancient and
ornate costume—this in a day when the more highly
civilized a man is the more simply he dresses. The bulk
of the nation betray this itching vanity in its persistent
struggle for things insignificant in themselves, but
whose attainment would inflate its pride and permit it to
exult over its step-children. If you can prove to me that
I am wrong, and that you are possessed by a nobler
motive in this agitation for the compulsory use of your
language throughout an army in which there are so
many Austrians, Germans, Roumanians, Saxons, Slavonians,
Bulgarians, and, above all, the Croats, who most
hate you, I shall be glad to acknowledge myself mistaken.”</p>

<p>Molnár’s eyes had flashed. He was vaguely jealous
of the American, bitterly as he realized that his disappearance
would leave no field for him. But he had
come to the palace determined to assist the cause of his
party, and not only did the quiet air of the room and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
company depress his energy of temper, but his deep
respect for the Archduchess, and desire to stand well
with her, would have restrained him from a violent
outburst. He replied with a calm which he was made
subtly aware his princess commended.</p>

<p>“It is difficult to prove what is so largely a matter of
standard. The Americans have so vast a country, so
many liberties unknown in Europe, but worthy of
emulation, that what seems the noble motive of pride to
us may appear quite petty to them. But after all, did
not your country, when under the heel of another power,
make mountains out of many mole-hills that you would
laugh at now? You tax yourselves more heavily than
England ever taxed you, and it is seldom that a voice
is raised in protest. The stamp-tax after your late war
is a case in point. You burned your British governors
in effigy, and now your contented and prosperous
people merely shrug their shoulders at the iniquities of
your bosses, confident that the country can take care of
itself. The great patriotic virtues that were extolled a
hundred years ago in the United States of America are
passed by now as a matter of course, or their absence is
unnoticed; and I remember reading that a large portion
of your country in its youth went quite hysterical at
the monarchical proposition that Mr. Washington’s head
should appear on coins. But I only wish to illustrate
that a young country lacking complete independence,
or fearful of losing that so recently acquired, is never
so indifferent to certain points as a great one.”</p>

<p>“I admit all the faults of my country past and present,
but it seems to me that if the law of progress means anything,
it means that a people dissatisfied with monarchical
government and bent upon republican should take
warning and example from the older republics—not act
as if every page of history had been destroyed. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
vanity stiffens into a monumental conceit, as in the case
of England and ourselves, it is still bad enough, and has
its dangers, but at least it is not childish, and is the
result of a developed strength that it would be next to
impossible to wreck. But being still weak as you are,
by your constitutional inferiority to Austria, and the
hatred with which you are regarded by almost every
other division and tribe in your share of the Dual
Monarchy, it doubly behooves you to eliminate your
weaknesses. And, I repeat, vanity is the one which
will prove most fatal. William played upon it in a
masterly manner; he uttered but a few words of flattery,
he took the trouble to learn but three words of your
language, and the nation wept tears of joy. I amuse
myself counting the number of mustaches—particularly
in the army!—that stand on end. If it had been the
tyrant of all the Russias, the momentary enthusiasm
would have been the same, although second thoughts
would have disillusioned you. That an enlightened and
progressive monarch chose to declare himself your friend,
no matter for what purpose of his own, you may count
as a piece of good fortune which you had done nothing
very especial to encourage. But do you flatter yourself
for a moment that if William took you over he would
permit the universal substitution of any language for his
own?”</p>

<p>“I was not of those whose heads were turned by the
Emperor of Germany,” snorted the Hungarian, whose
own mustache Nature had planted in a most aggressive
fashion. “The constant abuse of Hungary by the German
press, and the attempts of propagandists to corrupt
German-speaking Hungarians and unite them for
the propitious moment of rebellion against the country
their ancestors adopted—that Germany may have a
weakened state to oppose her when she is ready to put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
into execution her designs on the Balkans—those are
scores, sir, that an emperor cannot sweep from some
memories by flattery. I am—since the death of the Crown
Prince—” He hesitated and looked at the Archduchess.</p>

<p>“You are to speak with perfect freedom to-day,” she
said smiling, and endeavoring to feel as political as she
should. “That was the understanding when you consented
to come. Please believe that I am listening impersonally.
Not that I wish your secrets, merely your
well-defined point of view.”</p>

<p>“Then I will say what is well enough known, your
Royal Highness—that I wish for no king whatever.
Our king is as just and indulgent as his fixed notions
permit him to be, and yet under him autonomy is a
failure. I wish for complete independence, with, if not
all the features of the United States of America, at least
with those which have permitted her to exist in the face
of all prophecies; and with many others which we are
quite capable of evolving ourselves. Independence, you
will not hesitate to admit, sir, is the only logical condition
for any civilized people at this stage of the world’s
history, and, above all, it is the only condition which
will content the most independent race in Europe.
When the hour of this Dual Monarchy strikes, I am perfectly
willing that western Austria shall go to Germany,
provided that the price of our acquiescence is the complete
independence of this country. If the aristocracy
don’t like it they can move to Prussia; that country is
badly in need of a real aristocracy, and the fine clothes
of our magnates would be a pleasant relief among so
many uniforms. But for Hungary, Independence!—Independence!—Independence!”</p>

<p>His voice ended in a mild roar; and Fessenden replied
in his most matter-of-fact tones, “Then if you want
independence, why, I repeat, don’t you begin now to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
strengthen instead of weakening yourselves? Surely
you must know that if the King granted this demand of
yours, completely to Magyarize the army, you would
incur the still bitterer hatred of all these races who are
obliged to serve in it. Their native tongue means as
much to them as yours does to you. And when one
considers that three-fourths of Hungary is ethnologically
non-Hungarian! If your king were thirty years
younger, and you could reasonably feel that you had
that amount of time in which to subdue or reconcile
your rebellious step-children, then one might feel that
you had more wisdom, more reason on your side; but
to strain at a gnat when you must inevitably swallow
a whole herd of camels the moment your king sets these
centrifugal forces free, is a folly I cannot comprehend
in a race so like my own in many respects.”</p>

<p>Molnár had listened sullenly, but with attention. It
had been agreed, although all four of the Hungarians
were men of ability, that the brunt of the talk should be
borne by their leader; for they were sure to interrupt
even each other if they sent the blood to their heads
with too many words. But they were neglecting their
plates to follow the argument; and they frowned when
Fessenden spoke, and smiled approval upon the logic of
Molnár. When the American asserted the analogy between
his race and theirs, they looked pleased and surprised;
for it is a remarkable fact that, in spite of the execration
which Europeans, as a result of our protective
policy and successful invasion of her aristocracies and
industries, bestow upon the United States, they are invariably
surprised into pleasure if informed that they
possess an American trait—which is doubtless owing to
the fact that every human creature craves success; and
rightly or wrongly, the United States and that most
vulgarized of words are synonymous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>Even Molnár looked slightly mollified, but he had
come to make good his cause before a princess who he
believed must influence the King her father, since he
was convinced she could twist Hungary round her finger
if she chose. “It is to be hoped that another century
will see us even in advance of where the United States
stands to-day,” he replied; “for, as you justly observed,
it is our part as an intelligent nation to profit by the
mistakes of other nations. But it is impossible to admit
that we are unwise to insist upon the adoption of
our language as the sole language of our army, even
in the old age of the King; for we are convinced that
our disruption from Austria is but a question of a few
years, and it is wise to accustom the inferior races to the
dominance of our language and rule as long before our
independence as possible. It is our misfortune that
we have not been in a position to push this claim sooner.
It was a tremendous innovation when Kossuth and
Szechenyi carried their point that Magyar should be the
political language of Hungary. It was not the part of
wisdom to ask for more then, but that is half a century
ago—half a century. And you call us impatient and
unreasonable! You—who are so recently come from
the battle-field, do you recall the passionate enthusiasm
with which you sang and listened to your national
hymns by your camp-fires at night—as you marched to
the battle-field? What would have been your emotions
if you had been compelled to sing the national songs of
another country? Good God! Cannot you understand
what it would mean to us to sing our own beautiful battle
hymns in our own beautiful language, instead of the
words of a hated power in the most hideous sounds that
ever were invented to torture the ear? It is true that
you have set your national anthem to the tune of England’s,
but you have long since forgotten that; and I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
told that when Americans go to England they are flattered
when the band plays ‘God Save the King.’ But
that is your happiness—that you have been permitted
to forget—while we—we—”</p>

<p>“I have no doubt that if you asked for the privilege
of ringing your national hymns, and nothing more, the
King would readily indulge you; and the Hungarian
military colleges you are sure to have will no doubt
entail much that you wish—if you have the patience to
wait. I admit, of course, that vanity has no part in
your desire to sing your own anthems in your own language—what
more inspiring?—but the imposing of
your difficult tongue on the Austrians who are obliged
to command in your army during the years when you
must still have an insufficiency of Hungarian officers,
as well as upon the races that hate you now, and only
await the opportunity to serve you the same trick they
served you in 1847—I repeat, it seems to me the height
of vanity and folly. And I regret it deeply, for in a struggle
in which you were incontestably right, you would
have the sympathy of the United States. Kossuth is by
no means forgotten; and the American loves romance,
having so little of it. For romance you stand in history
preeminently. But if you make yourselves ridiculous—”</p>

<p>“Ridiculous?” All four were muttering. Ranata
leaned forward, and drew Molnár’s eyes to hers.</p>

<p>“How would it have been if Rudolf had lived?” she
asked softly.</p>

<p>“Ah, Rudolf!” The four men might have received an
electric shock. “If our crown prince had lived,” cried
Molnár, “he would be our sympathetic, our indulgent
ruler to-day. The King would surely have abdicated
in his favor before this—if he had been reluctant we
should have found a way to persuade him! The King<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
is preferable to his present heir; and not only do we
hesitate to incur the antagonism of the world by embittering
the last days of our old monarch, but it is a trait
of human nature to postpone the evil day. But Rudolf!
He would have granted our demands; and with his tact
and resource have found a way to reconcile all the other
states in the monarchy to our reforms. Perhaps he
would have given us our liberty, and accepted the presidency
of the republic! That indeed would have been
Utopia!”</p>

<p>“No one can admire and regret Rudolf more than I
do,” said Fessenden, in the even dispassionate tones
which irritated the Hungarians more than his words;
“but it is impossible not to notice that the inevitable
legend is growing up round his name. In a few years it
will obscure an individuality and a mental endowment
that were better left unexaggerated. I came on the scene
too late to know him, but I have heard him much discussed
by more than one of his close personal friends;
and while he was far more genial and sympathetic than
is common among princes, and far more liberal and
broad-minded, I do not in the least believe that he had
a republican instinct, or would have parted voluntarily
with an inch of his inheritance. Rather he would have
conceived it his mission to maintain its integrity with
the last corps of his army. No doubt his tact and his
alert modern brain would have found a way through
these difficulties which would have satisfied himself and
Hungary. Problems that seem insoluble to an aged
king might have been disentangled readily enough by
him. But the hard fact remains that you have not
Rudolf to deal with, but your king—and, for a period
after him, no doubt, the present Crown Prince; so would
you not be wiser to conciliate your enemies until you are
strong enough to crush them? Suppose Germany and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
Austria in a war against Russia—over the Balkans, let
us say—do you realize what your position would be as
an independent state with all the antagonistic races
within your borders in revolt—these races number
7,500,000, nearly half your population, do they not?
In some respects the Hungarian mind is the brightest
and most alert in Europe, and you are probably the only
monarchical people wholly without servility. If you
wreck yourselves, and this rich and enterprising country,
because you love your weaknesses more than your
virtues, then you deserve to be crushed like an egg between
the enemies who will take a particular delight in
the process. But your party does not represent Hungary.
The enlightened majority are not extremists.
You can obstruct and keep the country in a turmoil,
but when it comes to the general vote you must be
beaten. But meanwhile you are demoralizing Hungary
at home, and making it ridiculous abroad—that is the
point to be considered now.”</p>

<p>Molnár pushed back his chair and stood up, tossing
back his head. For the moment he looked like the
statue of the poet of the Revolution, Alexander Petöfi,
which, in its square across the river, seems to have
the nerves of the dead man in it.</p>

<p>“You pay us your cold tribute,” he cried, “but what
do you know of the ardor, the passionate enthusiasm
of a race as different from yours as the Latin from the
Teutonic. Logic! We have as much as any men
when our hearts are not on fire with our wrongs; but
we would rather die, die, die—be crushed like an egg,
if you will—than exist like slaves a generation longer.”
He turned suddenly to Ranata, his face illuminated
under its perpetual frown. “You—your Royal Highness”—he
cried, “if you were our queen—you, who
look born to sit on a throne as wisely as Maria Theresia,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
yet without her bigotry and obstinacy—you, who are so
like Rudolf— Ah! Why not? Why not?”</p>

<p>“We will have our coffee in the next room,” said the
Archduchess with cold severity, as she rose and led the
way. “Úr Molnár, have you seen the river and Pest
from the balcony?”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">XXI</h3>
</div>

<p>Fessenden and Ranata were alone in the Hungarian
house. Upon the departure of the Independents—diverted
and mollified—the Archduchess had dismissed
her weary ladies-in-waiting; and Alexandra, after wandering
down to the garden with her brother and friend,
had stolen away to sleep until the hour to drive.</p>

<p>“You heard!” said Ranata. “Do you doubt now
that I could be queen in Hungary?”</p>

<p>“I never doubted it; nor that your reign would be
as exciting as brief. Hungary is now enjoying her days
of halcyon peace. When your father dies she may not
only have your cousin of Austria, and William, to reckon
with, but King Karl of Roumania. It is the secret and
persistent ambition of his life to win back to Roumania
the lands it claims it owned before the conquest of Árpád,
and one of these is not only Transylvania, but Hungary
as far as the Theiss. He would join Austria in any
attempt to crush Hungary, and he would be abetted by
all the internal enemies of this country. Moreover, he
hates William as only one strong personality can hate
another, and at the first call of Hungary for the German
Emperor, or for his second son, he would not wait for
Austria. He is a big man in a small country, and has
never yet had his opportunity; but when it comes he
will grasp it, be sure of that. But have you not had
enough of all this for one day?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>“Yes—what a contrast you were! I never so fully
realized the destiny of the American race. Your brain
remains as cold as your eyes until the right moment
comes to let the fires leap up. And then! Tell me—I
have thought constantly of all that you said last night—it
seems to me that you felt yourself safe enough in
declaring that you would sacrifice everything for me—ambitions,
fortune, country—because you knew the
obligation never would confront you. It is I who
would have to renounce all and follow you. Austria
would expel us both, and could do you no
harm.”</p>

<p>“It is you who are most distressingly practical to-day.
Why analyze the vows of a lover? I spoke the language
of the heart last night, and my brain took the rest it needs.
You were convinced of my sincerity then—and I am
quite prepared to say it all over again.” And so he did;
but although he could make love with an intensity which
Ranata would be likely to recall in long hours of separation,
he was still able to practise the better part of valor;
and with the natural egotism of man, he was soon
talking into a sympathetic ear of his hopes and plans for
the future. Never was the egotism of man so wise in its
exercise. It was the last magnet he needed to draw the
soul of the woman to him. As he unrolled his vast
schemes, so practical and so ideal, Ranata forgot her own
conventional ambitions. She seemed to herself to step
out of a volume of history and mingle in the great throng
of individuals, who made their own laws and thought for
themselves.</p>

<p>“Before many years have passed,” said Fessenden, “I
hope to have united South America in one great republic.
It is not only necessary to protect my railways—the
element of personal selfishness must enter into everything
that hopes to succeed—but I want to see the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
republican ideal flourish over the greater part of the
civilized globe before I die.”</p>

<p>“And then? Shall you rule over these vast republics?”</p>

<p>“Not I! I shall have all the work I want while
creating them. There may come the crisis in the
United States which I have been trained to meet, and
the result might compel an interval of strong centralization.
But the reconstruction finished, those could rule
who were equal to the task. And such an interval
would be brief, for the American would not stand the
infringement of his liberties a moment longer than circumstances
demanded. Although I believe in permanent
centralization, to the extent of a ruler elected for
life or good behavior—and I believe this principle is
growing in the minds of all thinking republicans who
are not only sick of corruption but of seeing a fine
man in the presidential chair the slave of politicians, and
shelved coincidently with the full development of his
usefulness—still that ruler must be the free and deliberate
selection of the majority of the people, and a
monarch by their will alone, with no privileges whatever
for his heirs. With democracy I have no more patience
than with the autocracy of Russia, but I should be the
last to blight an instinct which it is my desire to sow
broadcast over the earth. It is for that I wish to be
remembered; they can forget the dramas as soon as they
like—”</p>

<p>“Ah, but tell me those!” exclaimed Ranata. “I have
waited for years to hear them.”</p>

<p>He entertained her with several of his adventures and
exploits in South America, but dropped the subject to
tell her something of his problem in mechanics and electricity.</p>

<p>“If anything was needed when I awoke at noon to-day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
to make me feel as if I owned the entire universe,”
he said, “it was a letter from my chief electrician which
convinced me for the first time that he was on the
verge of perfecting this old dream of mine. My father
was to go out as soon as telegraphed for and witness
the practical demonstration. Then, indeed, I practically
will hold the fate of the world in the hollow of my hand.”</p>

<p>Ranata stared hard at him, her pulse quickening. She
had always envied him, and now he seemed to her to
embody all the hopeful ambitions of all the world, a Titan
whom only a new country with its utter disregard of
failure could have produced. What order of men would
his republics bring forth?</p>

<p>“But shall you never have a reverse, never fail?” she
murmured. “There is a relentless law of compensation
in Nature; surely you must have your blows, your
bitterness, like other mortals.”</p>

<p>“I have already had enough trouble and anxiety, to
say nothing of hideous privations, fatigue, and illness to
satisfy Nature for the present. The only blow that could
have reached my heart before this would have been the
death of my father.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” she exclaimed sharply, “you do love me—I
know how much! When this is over, will its memory
mean as much to you as it will to me? Will the loss
embitter, discourage you? It has seemed to me since
last night that it will mean too much to me—that I
shall need more courage than I possess to live on.
With men—with you? How would it be, with your
thousand occupations where I might not have one?
Oh, at least help me to win this country! I fear no
enemies—nothing else on earth.”</p>

<p>“All that,” said Fessenden, “is a subject which I
positively refuse to discuss until these two months are
up. All I wish you to be firmly convinced of from this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
moment—and you might repeat it nightly with your
prayers lest you forget it—is that, under no possible
circumstances short of death, shall I give you up, or
relax for a moment in my determination to overcome
every obstacle which either you or your father may raise.
The sooner you recognize me as your destiny the better.”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">XXII</h3>
</div>

<p>When a woman is groping about among the mysteries
of her great passion she has little to give the world, and,
all the forces of her being consuming her inwardly, her
magnetism is diminished. With the average woman
this matters little—she merely bores her friends; but in
the case of a princess, with but a season perhaps at her
disposal within whose limits to preserve the map of
Europe, or alter it to her liking, the untimely advent
of love might blight her in the very plethora of her
opportunities. Ranata realized this danger after a
few days of complete indifference to anything but her
own thoughts and the presence of Fessenden Abbott,
discovered that she had fallen back into the niche of
the unapproachable princess, from which only he could
draw her. The moment she appreciated her condition
she roused, when in public, the energies of her mind,
wrenching it from her inner life. A career she was
determined to have; and although she could not recall the
enthusiasm of those first weeks in Hungary, her purpose
was revitalized by the long shadows of bitterness and
despair which the future cast back to her. True to her
compact, she endeavored to eject that future from her
imagination, and in greater part succeeded, for she had
more wisdom than most women, and appreciated the
priceless value of the immediate happiness. She was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
content, and in brief intervals intensely happy; her
imagination was liberated and her power to feel superlative.
The knowledge that both imagination and
capacity for living must prove her scourge hereafter
but made her cultivate both the more ardently while
briefly mistress of her fate. And the concentrated
ardor of which Fessenden was capable in the rare moments
they found alone, contrasted with his average
mood when he seemed to belong so wholly to himself,
fascinated her far more than any constant evidence of
her consuming influence over him would have done.
Her own powerful individuality recognized the separateness
of his, and was content to touch it in fugitive
moments only. The archaic poem of eternal oneness
made no appeal to her. Passionate love and loyal
friendship she had to offer in the fullest equipment
granted to mortals, but the development of her own
individuality in its incorruptible silences must go on
forever, submerged only by the primal tides; and so
her instincts and her endowment saved her from the
pursuit of that will-o’-the-wisp which most women follow
until it hides in the grave. She saw that Fessenden
recognized in her this disunion of temperament and
personality, for although his were the masculine limitations
which deprived him of the comprehensions women
think they want, the needs of his own soul were too
great for blindness to another that had come so close.</p>

<p>Therefore, Ranata, although she loved her hours of
solitude the more, and even grudged her brain its sleep,
reopened her windows to the world before it was too late.
She entertained frequently, and many of the magnates
gave superb entertainments in her honor. Fessenden,
Zrinyi, and several other young enthusiasts, arranged
an illuminated fête on the Danube, and for a few
moments she believed herself to be a fairy princess on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
fairy planet. Every house, great and small, on the
hills of Buda, burned its colored lights, and the bridges,
the islands, the boats, looked as if on fire with the
souls of stars and flowers. The fireworks among the
ruins of the castle on the height completed a scene of
illusion possible in only three or four cities of the world.</p>

<p>Her own entertainments were given in no perfunctory
fashion. She had one state dinner a week, and small
dinners and luncheons for the better study of the
Hungarian character. There was no theatre in the
palace, but she had a stage erected in the Hall of
Ceremonies, and Possart came from Munich to give the
soliloquy of Manfred among the snow-fields of the Alps,
in what is perhaps the most perfect German spoken in
a great empire where perfect German is seldom heard.
Fremstadt came with him to sing from “Carmen”; and
Frau Schratt and other artists of Vienna were engaged
for the later winter. The local poets were permitted to
declaim, and their emotional fires and abandon won
the English and American guests, long divorced from
patience with drawing-room inflictions.</p>

<p>But the Hungarians shone most brilliantly in music,
and there were frequent concerts in the palace, given
entirely by members of the aristocracy, which inspired
no comparison with professionals. When the Archduchess
found time she went to the theatre or opera,
and sat in the gala box, wearing her best conceived
gowns, and having taken care that her intention should
be announced in the morning newspapers.</p>

<p>And so Budapest had its gay winter at last—a winter
that exceeded even longings and dreams, and made the
heart of the tradesman sing, and filled the hotels with
curious and ambitious visitors. But perhaps the true
rapture dwelt in the pen of the correspondent, so long
driven in the mere service of politics for the casual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
glance of a world at no pains to understand that it might
yet be the destiny of Hungary to precipitate the great
convulsion of Europe. These grateful gentlemen quickly
made Ranata the most famous woman on the public
stage. Her pictures were sold in every capital, the
illustrated weekly newspapers presented her to a delighted
public in all her available aspects, and girl reporters
came to Budapest and wrote imaginary interviews with
her maids.</p>

<p>No one knew better than Ranata that this glitter and
tinsel was but the prelude to true fame, and that without
the opportunity to prove her wisdom as a ruler she would
take no place in history outside the covers of some
“Book of Beauty”; nevertheless she found the notoriety
and incense sweet after her long monotonies, and her
pride was deeply gratified with the unequivocal success
of her first programme. She would have been more
satisfied if she could have had proof of the jealous uneasiness
of William of Germany; and more secure if the
state of mind of the Crown Prince of Austria and Hungary
could have been revealed to her. But if Fessenden
corresponded with his friend he made no confidences;
and neither her father nor Count von Königsegg mentioned
her cousin in their letters, although they appeared
to commend her course.</p>

<p>But to Ranata’s surprise and occasional alarm, she
frequently discovered that her imagination dwelt less
on her future in history than on the great schemes of
Fessenden Abbott, and that her thoughts were far more
occupied with their unique and interesting details than
with the future complexities of Europe, which long since
had acquired the habit of repeating themselves. Gone
were the hours when she had striven to untangle the web
of her empire’s future, to fit herself for every imaginable
contingency. When her womanhood took its temporary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
rest, her brain was far more apt to dwell upon some point
that was puzzling Fessenden. She reminded herself
that this may have been the result of their daily conversations,
his abrupt confidential asides; and believed
she might assure herself that when the spell was removed
her interest in subjects so foreign to all in her
previous twenty-eight years would vanish with the
sweetness of life.</p>

<p>But they were not foreign to everything, she suddenly
reminded herself. There was Alexandra! Would
this sense of intimacy with the brother have descended
upon her so quickly, even with the assistance of love,
had it not been preceded by that other long intimacy?
How deep had the influence of this American sunk?
What changes had it perhaps wrought in her character
during those eighteen years of almost constant mental
friction, beginning when her mind was plastic, and always
making her chief interests in life? Nothing is
more difficult than to concentrate the mind in self-analysis,
self-examination; the children of the experience
resent the scientific probing of the mind and hide in the
shadowy deeps. Ranata was forced to recur to the
subject abruptly, to glimpse her mental layers by flashlight.
It was difficult even then to make sure what
tracings had been done by an alien hand, much less to
imagine just what she would have been had that hand
been withheld; but finally she learned enough to cause
her moments of deep uneasiness, grave doubts if she
were so inviolate a Hapsburg as she had believed; and
when she realized there had been intervals when her
emancipated and now rebellious imagination had transported
her to the American continent, where she moved
with the assurance and the vivid sense of freedom of
the American girl, she shrank in terror, as if already
she had taken a traitorous and irrevocable step. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
had always been convinced that she should find all
things in the American section of America quite detestable,
from their very unlikeness to all things sanctified
by the traditions of Europe; but now she emerged from
visions of herself penetrated with happiness in a romantic
wilderness of mountain and forest, or in cities which
epitomized that wonderful modern life which seemed
to relegate the old to boards and calf-skin. There were
times when she actually felt the rush and fever of the
life in her veins. It was then that she turned her mind
to Hungary. She had been deeply gratified to learn
that on the greater portion of the Left, William had
made no impression, except to deepen their hatred and
distrust of Germany. That this enthusiastic and ofttimes
desperate party was being secretly drawn to her
standard, Ranata was not long discovering. For a
time, at least, they would accept a queen where they
would reject a king, and their susceptible natures inclined
them naturally towards a young and beautiful ruler
whom they could love, and, no doubt, manage; while
she added to their picturesque strength in the eyes of
the world. Ranata was aware that the new thought
was travelling silently; and while trembling lest it reach
Vienna, she dared not notice it sufficiently to demand
prudence. The part must be thrust upon her, not only
to save her in the eyes of Europe, but the lightest hint
of ambition from her would have alarmed the Independents
and turned their admiration to contempt.</p>

<p>There were times during this strange interlude in her
life when she was possessed by a sensation of supreme
joy, or by deep and tranquil happiness—moments when
she paced the terrace alone on brilliant mornings in a
tumult of wonder, when Budapest, beautiful enough,
was glorified, and the links binding her to the mundane
were dissolved. In such moments she neither analyzed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
nor speculated, she but intensely lived; but when they
had passed, she wondered if such ideally pagan moments
were prophetic of greater happiness, or if they
were peculiar to that antechamber of the unknown which
is the prelude in love. The possibility depressed her,
and at other times she suffered sharply. If Fessenden
carelessly laid his arm about Alexandra’s shoulders or
took her hand, satisfied in the masculine fashion with
what happened to be convenient at the moment, Ranata
would turn cold with jealousy and disgust with life. As
she was too proud to protest—or explain—she punished
the bewildered offender with a freezing demeanor, and
both were miserable for several days. The reconciliation,
however, enshrined the misery in a halo of gratitude.
Her jealousy was purely impersonal, and induced
no alteration in her attitude towards Alexandra. It
was not the object but the apparent wandering of his
affections that concerned her, and the physical manifestation.
She took for granted that he loved his sister—would
have thought him deficient in human nature if
he had not. But that sort of relation was passive; the
active he had entered upon embraced her alone. Like
other women in love, she was constantly making discoveries
about herself; and when, one day, alone with her
thoughts, she found herself overwhelmed and dissolved
in a transport of maternal tenderness for the man to
whom ultimately she could be nothing, she realized for
the first time how far love had carried her. This was
towards the end of the interlude; and soon after, even
the uneasiness of this discovery was forgotten in the
haunting dismay which preceded the end.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Zrinyi was manifestly impatient that the
visit should be made to his castle in the Transylvanian
Alps before the full rigors of winter should compel an
indefinite postponement. So far, the winter was mild,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
and the snow on the lower Alps not so heavy that oxen
could not draw the sledges up the steep mountain roads.
Ranata, welcoming a few days’ release from the world,
and greater freedom, set the date; and it was arranged
that the party should consist only of her ladies, Alexandra,
Fessenden Abbott, and Prince Illehazy. They were
to linger long enough in Klausenbourg, Kronstadt, and
the intervening villages, to give the inhabitants a
glimpse of their princess, and an opportunity to offer
the ovation which once had been their joy to give to
Rudolf.</p>

</div>

<p>When one is standing in a window looking down into a
gorge a thousand feet below, the cynical reflections of a
mummy in bed smoking a cigar vex the impulse of romance,
quick in the brain. Ranata was in the window.
The window was Zrinyi’s; so was the perpendicular
mountain of which the old border fortress might have
been an abrupt continuation, so indeed were the harsh
wild peaks, bare but for the glittering snow, which rose
high above this lofty height. The mummy was Sarolta,
who was in bed with a cold. The invasion of her sacred
person by impertinent microbes always put her in a bad
humor, and to-day it urged her to improve one of her
rare solitudes with her royal charge. Moreover, she
was profoundly puzzled. If Ranata was not in love
with this American, why then did she show him a
preference never before won, for a moment, by another
admirer? But if she were in love, why then this serenity?
She had expected that Ranata’s inevitable love
episode would be fraught with tragedy from the very
first, and that pallid cheeks and heavy eyes would be
the visible signs, haughtily as the Princess might comport<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
herself. Had the heroine been any one but Ranata
she might have drawn a characteristic deduction from
this serenity; but although she was not the European to
swear to the virtue of any woman, she knew that Ranata,
if not bigotedly virtuous, was bigotedly loyal to her
house, and had long since made her vow that by no act
of hers should another of its stones be loosened; rather
was she exalted by the hope that it might be her destiny
to save it from destruction. And Sarolta, who had settled
back comfortably into her early doctrine that life
was made to live, could have gone to the stake herself
for the aristocratical or the monarchical ideal. Therefore,
she believed that Ranata would immolate her passion
on this altar the moment it burned too fiercely; and
so, after all, was prepared to take her oath upon the
virtue of one woman. Nevertheless, she was curious. Of
the compact, of course, she knew nothing; and had she,
still would she have puzzled, knowing the power and the
will of woman to torment herself; but she had come to
the conclusion that it was possible Ranata, never having
seen Fessenden alone—this the good lady also believed—did
not wholly realize her condition, would not until
he left her; so determined to do what she could in the
way of preliminary disenchantment.</p>

<p>“There is no greater fallacy,” she was saying, “than
the belief that women regret their youth—I mean women
who have lived the life of the heart. Nature invariably
compensates, and in exchanging wisdom for youth
she is at her best. No woman ever crowded more into
her youth—nor held to it longer—than I did, yet I can
recall now the sensation of relief when I finally realized
that henceforth I should live for myself alone; above
all, that I had had my final disappointment. For love,
my dear, is one exquisite disappointment from first to
finish—for the woman, I mean. Men are rarely psychological<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
enough for the disappointments that grind
the heart of woman until it is callous. When they are,
they are not able to hurt us, so may be left out of the
question. The thoroughly masculine man, the only sort
that is capable of inspiring the <i>grande passion</i>, because
he has the primal attributes designed by Nature that
he may fully mate with woman, is in the very completeness
of his equipment blind to all that is most subtle
and feminine in woman, giving her, therefore, twenty
strokes of torment to one of happiness, or even pleasure.
What is the result? We live, the most irresistible of us,
three-fourths—five-eighths—of our lives alone, striving
to find in imagination what man will never give us. Life,
with women who are not small pieces of pulp in the domestic
mill, is one long chase after happiness—what is
there for most of us but happiness, politics, and charities?
I have sometimes envied the women who have to work
their brains blunt to fill their conservative little stomachs!”</p>

<p>Her voice thickening, she paused to inhale the fumes
of the last specific for colds. Ranata continued to stare
out of the window, and her duenna continued in a
moment:</p>

<p>“But I have also wondered, <i>ma chère</i>, if, did man give
us what that craving thing we call our soul demands,
would we enjoy ourselves even as much as we do. It
is always a gamble which will tire first, the man or the
woman; and on the whole I am inclined to believe that
the woman of charm and brain, and the position in life
which enables her to find much distraction, is the surer
prey to disenchantment. If she be of a deeper nature,
or if she has deluded herself for a little that the man
actually loved her and not himself, she may not tire,
but be so bitterly disgusted and disillusioned that, for a
moment, at least, she is capable of tragedy. But the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
average man, so particular with charm at first, merely
lets us down in <i>ennui</i>. If he gave woman more of himself
than he does now, perhaps she would tire sooner.
He needs all the mystery he has. However, the fact
remains that man is eternally unsatisfactory and woman
eternally unsatisfied. I doubt if a woman of imagination
ever lived who, having won what rent her
soul and body while withheld, would not, after the first
short chapter, exchange the reality for the previous
lost world of her imagination. Good God! the disillusionment,
the readjustment, the struggle through
terror and despair to philosophy! If I were ordered to
live my life over, I should demand, in compensation, the
ever-fresh memory of a great and unsatisfied passion—after
having known one man in the daily life of
matrimony. A woman is briefly happy twice in her
life—when a man—the man—is pursuing her, and
palpitating doubt alternates with delicious certainty;
and again, during the man’s first ardor, when he is so
anxious to please, and so certain that he loves the
woman, not himself, that his concentrated charm blinds,
yet irradiates the universe. Shortly after, he becomes
as matter-of-fact as he is. And then men are, no matter
what their brains, utterly, irretrievably stupid where
women are concerned. A man is never so happy as
when he has lost the love of the woman, and she, taking
refuge in duty, makes him thoroughly comfortable.
On the other hand, men are abruptly left by women,
again and again, and the cleverest of them never guess
the reason why. They go on ruining their own lives—which
they never suspect—and those of the women best
worth having, without learning a lesson from the past.
There is no happiness, my dear, until you are as old
as I am, look like a mummy, and smoke <i>vuelta abajo</i>.”</p>

<p>“Of course I recognize that all that was meant for me.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
Her charge left the window and stared down at her.
She puffed out a cloud, for Ranata’s eyes always made
her blink. “But I am surprised that a woman of your
wisdom should fancy that the person ever lived who
would adjust his life by the experience of another.”</p>

<p>“You have a brain. Most women have not. You will
always be more or less guided by it. Therefore, you
are worth the trouble to warn.”</p>

<p>“You are the last person I should have expected
advocate the happiness of the unknown; but I have
thought that out for myself, and more than once. I
believe that the only way a woman can avoid the cut
of her sex is to avoid the fulfilment of love. Then the
fates are placated, and, after the first wrench, permit
the imagination a certain happiness, the soul a certain
elevation, no doubt impossible in what must eventually
become prosaic and disappointing.”</p>

<p>“I am not surprised that you have arrived at that
truth by yourself; and be sure that all the troubles in
the world amount to little if you can bear them alone,
and that no troubles, barring poverty and pain, count
an infinitesimal speck in the balance with those made
by love, or the desperate attempt to find happiness.
Indeed, I will modify what I said just now, and stake
my life that a woman is happy only when she is not in
love. There is no such thing as sympathy between
the soul of man and woman. The man who thinks he
sympathizes with a woman’s subtle wants is a milksop.
The other, the only sort we love, doesn’t try, never
thinks about it; and either way we are miserable,
having the primal curse of Eve upon us. So, the
old maids, or the quickly widowed, have the best of it
in this life. Doubtless things are better arranged in
another.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps in that we will be born without imagination.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
I don’t know but that would be the deepest definition of
heaven after all.”</p>

<p>“I think it more likely that in alternate existences the
man of one is the woman of another,” said Sarolta dryly.
“That would be Nature and her compensations as we
know them. On the whole she is just.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">XXIV</h3>
</div>

<p>Fessenden was walking restlessly about the hall of the
castle, awaiting the finish of Ranata’s visit of duty at the
bedside of her duenna. There was a prospect, for the
first time in several days, of an hour with her alone.
Zrinyi, Prince Illehazy, Vilma, and Alexandra had gone
for a walk, and Piroska had not been seen that day.</p>

<p>They had arrived two days before, after three, in a
special train with many pauses and no solitudes, and
until now had been a gay and united party. Alexandra
had announced herself satisfied with the castle; but
as her tone had been frivolous, Zrinyi had forborne to
press his suit. The roughness of the old days of border
warfare was curiously blended with the modern comforts
of a nobleman’s hunting-lodge. The staircase,
towards which Fessenden directed eyes of impatient
longing, looked as if no woman had ever descended it,
although many women had huddled there when the
Turkish guns were battering. The logs in the old
fireplace, and the big ornamental stones which have
superseded andirons in the greater part of Europe,
tempered the ancient cold; the rough walls and floors
were covered with the skins of wild beasts and other
trophies of the chase; and the chairs at least were
comfortable. The hall was a museum of old battle-flags,
captured from the Turks, Austrians, rival clans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
in the days of the Oligarchs, and of weapons as old
and varied. The castle was very large, and had been
surrounded on three sides by a double moat; but to
former implements of war it had been impregnable,
and the unsquandered wealth of the family had kept
every part of it from decay except the entrance wall.
Fessenden thought it an admirable setting for a honeymoon;
failing that, for a few days’ final courtship.</p>

<p>But his patience, never a gift of Nature, but a creation
of his will, was close upon its finish, and the day he
left Budapest he had set his train in motion. Only his
habit of playing a close and far-seeing game had saved
him from some precipitate act which might have wrecked
his hopes; for the blood was often in his head. Whether
or not Mr. Abbott had had such a crisis as this in mind
when he trained his son in the qualities that conquer,
in no other way had they served Fessenden so well.
He was pitting his wit and his wealth against the
mightiest prejudice which existed in the world of his
day; and his victory over Ranata must spring solely
from the former, for without it her love would avail
him nothing. Had he been able to conquer her prejudices
by any of the arts of love or passion he would
have urged a flight from this castle—which was far from
communication with the telegraph, and where the sympathetic
Zrinyi would have kept guardians and spies
imprisoned—to Trieste, where his yacht awaited him.
But he knew that Ranata, although capable of a revolution
which would raze the first wall between them, must
accomplish that revolution in solitude and despair, under
the pressure of circumstances which he had already
shaped. The demolishment of the second wall might
cost him something almost as dear as the woman, but
Fessenden was prepared to sacrifice more than that.</p>

<p>Fortunate for the great affairs of the house of Abbott,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
that the senior was particularly well at this time! The
heir, for all his self-control, was in a state of mind which,
had he been compelled to return—and nothing short of
his father’s death or a financial panic would have drawn
him across the seas—would have lost him the faith of
Wall Street.</p>

<p>Since his violent attack of calf-love and the strange
illuminations which had succeeded it, he had looked upon
woman with a critical eye, and treasured his inmost feelings
with a jealous care. Never again, he had determined
long since, would he go through that futile agony at the
instance of anything less than death; when he found the
one woman whom he could love more than his life or his
ambitions—or as well—then would he pour all he had
husbanded at her feet; but he would have her unless
the Almighty himself intervened. Busy as was his life,
he had been sharply aware of its incompleteness; there
had been many hours of longing for the deep companionship
of love, for the perfection of his own soul and
manhood. The vague ideal of his dreams he had not
recognized in Ranata’s physical part when they met in
the cottage, his sense of adventure being keener than
any vital longing, and the fury of the dance excluding
mental knowledge of his partner. But he had discovered
her not long after; and the great measure that he
had to offer of homage and love and passion had since
burned steadily; with a less strong brain the flame
would have been less steady, and the rare moments of
solitude with her, and their temptations, might have overwhelmed
him: he had never imagined a woman who
could so crowd into a moment the concentrated essence
of all the melting tenderness and the passionate energy
that made up the surrender of woman. It is true that
more than once the temptation had assailed him to use
her weakness as the shortest way out of the difficulties<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
that beset him; but not only had he so far never taken
advantage of any one but a scoundrel, and did he still
hold women in an old-fashioned reverence, but he forecast
the weeks—perhaps months—asunder, when
in desperation she might marry any prince her father
selected. And in his cooler moments he tingled at the
thought of a victory which would be as great for his
young country as for himself, of being the chosen instrument
to initiate a new order of things as inevitable as
the progress of the world. Romantic as he was, the
campaign he had planned—where the only weapons
should be his own wit and the millions which the world,
with its curious love of self-delusion, affects to despise,
typifying as they do modern life itself—appealed to
him more powerfully than a flight across a picturesque
country of many costumes to his yacht, or a rescue from
the palace of Buda. But at present he was not rehearsing
his plan of campaign; the coming moment commanded
his imagination, and the blood was beginning
to pound in his ears when he heard the light rustle of her
garments. He sprang up the stairs and met her on
the first landing.</p>

<p>“Not here!” she said nervously. “Sarolta is in bed,
and Piroska has a toothache; but who knows?”</p>

<p>“Has it ever occurred to you that the Countess
Piroska is a spy?” he asked as they crossed the hall to
the room Zrinyi called his study, although it had not a
book in it.</p>

<p>“Possibly,” said Ranata indifferently. “We are accustomed
to spies. That is usually one of the duties of
the Obersthofmeisterin. But as Sarolta is too wealthy
to be bought, and is of a proved fondness for me, I suppose
Count von Königsegg thought it wise to have one
in my household he could count on. I doubt if she has
made any report of consequence so far, for she has bided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
her time, hoping that the worst would happen; but she
will, for she wants to marry you. But it will matter little
now! Our time is almost up!”</p>

<p>She spoke in a tone of profound dejection. The serenity
she had maintained in Sarolta’s presence had
dropped from her like a mask. In a moment she withdrew
from his embrace and leaned against the window-frame
and stared down into the ravine where so many
Turks had mouldered to dust.</p>

<p>“It is time for the comedy to end,” she said sharply.
“Sarolta knows, and before long will interfere. Königsegg
is sure to interrogate Piroska before long, if he
has not done so already, and there must be many comments
in Budapest and Vienna on your long stay here
and your constant presence in the palace. Moreover,
it is impossible you should remain away from America
much longer. The two months you set yourself have
nearly passed. Let us talk plainly. My capacity for
self-deception is at an end—indeed, for days past it has
slipped from me again and again—and I am worried
about many other things—”</p>

<p>“What things?” asked Fessenden gently. He gathered
his faculties and stood looking at her, from the
other side of the narrow window, with his piercing and
concentrated glance; but he took her hand and held it
tenderly. “At least, if we are soon to part, let there be
as little to regret as possible. You owe me your confidence—nor
is there any one else to whom you would
give it.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” she exclaimed. “That is true enough! To
no other have I ever been as—been frank at all. No
one else has ever known me, nor ever can. It has given
me the most intellectual and voluptuous delight fully to
reveal myself for once in my life—I suppose I do not yet
realize how much. After all, why should I complain?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
I have had what most women never find. And I have
that sense of the indestructible bond. I shall have it as
long as I live. How many that flutter over this earth,
do you suppose, have that sense of an everlasting indissoluble
embrace? You feel it now. Will you? Will it
content you—that sense of spiritual completeness—can
you be faithful to that?”</p>

<p>“I should be very grateful for it if I could not find
anything better, and I am as capable of complete fidelity
as you are. But tell me what other things have worried
you.”</p>

<p>“It is this—” Her rising excitement flashed the blood
into her face, and she pushed her unsteady hand into her
hair, lifting it, as if its weight oppressed her. “In these
weeks that have slipped along so easily, so naturally, in
which we have found so much happiness, I have—I had
grown as accustomed to it all as any engaged girl. My
imagination seemed to sleep, or only to give me to you
in the future. Nothing in me protested, warned, except
a mechanical effort of intellect. It all seemed the
most natural thing in the world. I thought when I entered
into that compact that I should lead a dual mental
life; or rather that I should be wholly yours when with
you, and wholly myself when alone, fully alive to the end.
But I have been wholly yours when alone, and as wholly
oblivious of the future. And that is not all. It needed
only you and what you brought me to fill me with
a joyous abandon of liberty such as a man might feel
who saw and could walk alone for the first time. I had
felt something of this before you came, for the sudden
change from prison to a comparative freedom almost
turned my head; but since you—who breathe liberty,
who typify it, who seem to exhale the very essence of
your wonderful young country—you who fear no one!
who fear no one!—Am I still myself? Am I, Fessenden?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
That is the thought that has tortured me these last few
days—am I unfaithful in some subtle way to my house,
to myself, to the future, to Europe, to all that slaves
born in the purple should be most steadfast to? Rudolf
may have been weak, but he killed himself in a moment
when he was mad with his loathing of life and the methods
by which he had sought to forget it; but he was incapable
of deserting his post deliberately, and if his mind
could have been occupied by the duties of a ruler he
would have had no time for despair. But I—I feel as if
this secret revolution in me had made me capable of
greater than weakness—that is common enough in my
class! It has bred in me an indifference—there, I have
said it!—to all that I have held most sacred. I feel as
if I had slipped into another world. My rigid love of
duty, even my old superstitions, they have—they had
gone. But I have dragged them back. Last night as
I lay awake it seemed to me that I clawed them out of
their graves and shook and warmed them into life. I
have escaped a deadly peril. I know that when you
have gone I shall gradually become myself again—if not
quite the same, if without enthusiasm, at least I shall
fit into the old routine—”</p>

<p>“And you believe that?” asked Fessenden. “You
will no more fall back into your old state of mediæval
ignorance and superstition than I shall be wholly myself
until I possess you. You have been remade. You have
come to life, and only in me. You will return neither
to separateness nor to ignorance. The imagination is
quiescent while companioned—but wait!”</p>

<p>“Do you know, there have been moments when, if
you had asked me, I believe I should have fled with you
to your yacht? I don’t know myself! I almost long to
have you gone that I may suffer to the utmost capacity
of my nature, and then adapt myself to the future.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>He had taken out his watch. “By carriage and a
good many changes of train we could reach Fiume some
time to-morrow; a telegram on the way will bring my
yacht there. Will you go?”</p>

<p>“Oh! No, I will not go! It is bad enough that I am
tempted. Oh, I want to go, I want to go, more than I
have ever wanted anything on this earth! Another man
would make it inevitable, but you will not; and in a few
days I shall be battling with regrets, and hating myself
the more.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, and with little enthusiasm. “I could
compel you, and you would love me the more for it; but I
should not love myself. It would not be playing a fair
game. I have a Puritanic conscience as an inheritance;
also I have the instinct of the American to protect women—girls,
perhaps, I should say; to look upon them as
his chief responsibility. That is pounded into us early.
And I have lived so much within myself that it would
demoralize me to fall too far below my own standard—God
knows, I fall below it often enough. Moreover, if I
gave way to my passions you might—were our escape
interrupted—suffer so terribly that it chills my blood
whenever I think of it. I believe that is the one thing—the
knowledge that you were in your father’s power,
unable to escape—that would send me off my head. And
it is necessary that I keep my head until I am able in
all ways to protect you.”</p>

<p>“Have you noticed,” asked Alexandra of Zrinyi, as
the Archduchess descended the staircase, “that our
princess has, until to-night, for the past week worn only
black or white?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>“Why should I notice a trifling detail like that?”
asked Zrinyi sulkily. “If she look beautiful, what
matters her dress?”</p>

<p>“You don’t deserve to be asked intelligent questions.”</p>

<p>Ranata was trailing down the rough old staircase,
between smoking lamps almost as old, in a green velvet
gown of many hues, any one of which would have
enhanced the brilliancy of her skin and hair. The neck
of the gown was cut squarely, and a high stiff collar of
white lace rose behind her head. Her skin was bare of
jewels, her hair piled high and without ornament. In
her cheeks was a deep flush, her eyes sparkled restlessly,
her face had escaped from its habitual repose. Her
whole figure expressed vigor, energy, impatience ill-confined.</p>

<p>“If it were not the Princess, one would almost say she
looked reckless,” murmured Piroska to Fessenden, who
was staring at the vision—the only one of the company,
perhaps, who found nothing foreign in Ranata’s appearance.
Piroska compelled him to transfer his gaze.
“That is the way I have always imagined a girl might
look who had made up her mind to elope,” she continued.</p>

<p>Fessenden started slightly, and quick as he was with
his words, the Countess noticed it. “The Princess has
the cruelty of your sex,” he replied. “She doubtless
occupies a very considerable part of her time thinking
out new gowns with which to distract us.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you look more hopeless?” whispered
Piroska.</p>

<p>“Must you have men who wear their hearts upon their
sleeves?”</p>

<p>“No; but no man can wear a mask forever, unless he
is secretly happier than he would have us believe.”</p>

<p>“I am always happy; it is a mere matter of temperament.”
He paused deliberately and looked at her.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
“Moreover,” he added, “I have no intention of failing.”
And then he joined the group about the Archduchess.
They had parted but two hours before, and although he
had never been so convinced of her love for him, there
had been nothing then of the almost reckless promise
which her eyes seemed to flash to his as the movement
was made towards the lower end of the room. What
did it mean? Had an hour of solitary thought in the
dark, before her maids came to dress her, beaten her
passion so high that it had overwhelmed her traditions
at last, and urged her to take advantage of this opportunity
for flight? He turned giddy at the thought
and suddenly realized that deeply enamoured as he was
with the idea of manipulating princes, his want of
the woman extinguished this ambition among others, and
that he found incomplete happiness something more
than torment.</p>

<p>The hall was of immense proportions, and the dining-room
being far off, beyond many chill corridors, the
table was spread at the end farthest from the doors that
opened directly upon a platform in front of the castle.
The cannon were still in the embrasures. In the light
of the many, yet insufficient, lamps the room with its
battle-flags and weapons, its skins and dim hangings
embroidered with the old arts of Hungary, so recently
revived, was feudal enough to please the most exacting
American.</p>

<p>“Count,” murmured Alexandra, “if you could only
provide an earthquake shock among other phenomena
I believe I should no longer resist.”</p>

<p>“You need an earthquake,” he replied. “But, of
course, I am gratified, and hopeful, at the conquest of
the castle.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t care to live here all the year round,
however.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>“Heaven forbid! even with the most adored of women.
Give me the capitals of the world in winter.”</p>

<p>“It is a great comfort to feel that our tastes are so
much alike!” And she thought, “The Hungarians may
be two-thirds fire and impulse, but no American could
take his cues more quickly.”</p>

<p>Zrinyi, who was not in a sentimental mood, continued:
“I have a surprise for this night, if not an earthquake.
I find that the peasantry all through these
mountains have been much excited since they heard
the Princess was coming here—that is to say, the sister
of Rudolf. Most of the young men were beaters at one
time or another for him, and those who were not, and
the old and the women, invariably managed to see him
when he came to Görgény. His delightful manners,
combined with the halo of monarchy, made them worship
him in a manner which few modern princes have
known—Ludvig II. perhaps furnishes the only parallel.
Nor will they believe him dead. They know that our
princess resembles him in many respects, and doubtless
they have some sort of hope that she can give them
definite news of him, that perhaps she has come to
announce his return from the dim unknown. So I have
sent men about inviting them to come here to-night.
She has another opportunity to draw to herself the love
that has been wasted since Rudolf’s death. I am grateful
that she is looking her best to-night, for although
she is always beautiful, she has appeared less brilliant
of late.”</p>

<p>“She wears color to-night,” said Alexandra dryly;
“that is the whole secret.”</p>

<p>“I am not a fool, mademoiselle; I understand quite
well, and sincerely wish she could be happy. But
unhappiness is the fate of princes. They are born in
sacrifice, and they die in it, having known little else.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
But our princess has so much to give—it is a great pity
I don’t waste my sympathies on them as a rule. And
your brother—it is his first disappointment? It will
go hard with him, but any man worth the name can
get over anything.”</p>

<p>“That is comforting! If Ranata and Fessenden suddenly
made up their minds to run off, should you help
them?”</p>

<p>“Run off? Great Heaven! How could you conceive
such a thing even in jest? The Hapsburgs have done a
good deal for love—but that!”</p>

<p>“An American? That is the point? It would be a
good beginning.”</p>

<p>“I have always wondered,” murmured Zrinyi, “why
you did not put three heads on your eagle while you
were about it.”</p>

<p>“The two-headed one was sufficiently absurd to deter
us. You have not answered my question. Should you
help them?”</p>

<p>“I suppose I should. My sympathies would be with
them as lovers, being in such a deplorable condition
myself. But I should not approve, for I believe in the
principle of monarchy, and that would deal it a heavy
blow. But a liaison—there is no objection to that if it
were circumspectly managed. That shocks your American
prudery; but in the case of princes it is a desirable
outlet for the feelings they have in common with the
rest of human-kind, especially when a still more vital
principle is at stake. Our princess can preserve this
monarchy if any one can, and I for one would welcome
her as the solution; for William, with all his great qualities,
is perhaps a trifle too high and mighty for Hungary,
and his second son is still an unknown quantity.
It would be criminal in her to desert us, but a liaison
would do no one any harm.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>“I don’t take monarchies as seriously as you do, and
I have brought up Ranata too well—she will have no
liaisons. Besides, my brother plays for high stakes. It
is the best or nothing with him.”</p>

<p>“Men have been known to take what they could get;
and there are elements in our princess which are beyond
even your training. To-night she looks like a beautiful
ripe fruit hanging heavily from the tree. The Hapsburgs
have bad blood in them; not a drachm of the Puritanism
of the Hohenzollerns. The Princess has it in her to be a
great sovereign, but—<i>bien</i>; the world is her oyster; why
should she not open it?”</p>

<p>“If I marry you it will be to reform your morals. Not
that they are worse than those of any other European.”</p>

<p>“American morals are <i>bourgeoise</i>.”</p>

<p>“So is its hypocrisy! But we like things that way. I
may even make an American of you yet.”</p>

<p>“I have no objection to being an American if I can
live in Europe. And all the Americans I have met seem
to make no difficulty about that. I suppose your excellent
father would not wish me to go into business with
him?”</p>

<p>“I am sure he would not!”</p>

<p>“Sarolta,” murmured Prince Illehazy, “I have been
uneasy for some time. Has not the moment come to
speak?”</p>

<p>“I have spoken—this afternoon—and her philosophical
calm staggered me.”</p>

<p>“I see no evidence of philosophical calm.”</p>

<p>“It is a transformation I do not understand—although
I understand it as a manifestation better than
the philosophy. I shall ask Mr. Abbott to go as soon
as we reach Budapest, and doubtless he would be
obliged to return to America very soon in any case;
although I had a letter yesterday from his step-mother,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
and she seemed to take his long absence without protest.
I do not care to do anything further without something
more specific as an excuse than the young man’s
devotion, and an expression of reckless defiance worn
for one evening. Besides, we have Piroska to do the
spying. The King will not remain too long unwarned.
But Ranata’s love-affair hardly worries me as much as
this perhaps too sudden popularity. I fear it may be
overdone, and will alarm Franz, possibly the King.
Ranata has not a thought of usurpation. I am convinced
of that. But—”</p>

<p>“Exactly. I saw Königsegg when I was in Vienna
last week, and he tried in his delicate way to pump me.
He learned nothing, but I did. The wind is blowing the
wrong way. If the Princess, in a moment of haughty
forgetfulness, drops her policy of conciliation towards
Königsegg, or he becomes suddenly fearful of American
influence—for Mr. Abbott may go, but he will return,
or I know nothing of men—or the minister fears to anger
the heir—then our beautiful princess will go back
to her cage in the Hofburg.”</p>

<p>“In that case I should not care to be the Emperor,”
remarked the Princess Sarolta.</p>

<p>Ranata suddenly lifted her hand. “I hear such a
peculiar noise,” she said. “Is a storm rising?”</p>

<p>The rest became aware of a deep low murmur, not unlike
the rolling in of tides. Zrinyi left the table hastily
and looked from one of the narrow windows at the upper
end of the hall.</p>

<p>“I will send for your cloaks,” he said, “and then I
shall ask you to step out on the platform for a moment.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later he threw open the great doors of
the hall, and the party stared silently at the scene before
them. The full moon swung close to the ice-fields, the
white harsh peaks high above. In the court-yard, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
the small plain beyond, on every snowy hill and rock,
were crowded hundreds of men clad in the skins of the
sheep, the wolf, the goat, and the bear. On their heads
were high fur hats, which exposed but a fringe of long
hair on their shoulders and concealed their brows, giving
them an aspect of singular wildness. But they were
very quiet, almost breathless, until Zrinyi stepped forward
and shouted something in Roumanian. Then each
man lifted a flute to his lips, and a sweet and savage
melody stole forth gently, to rise and swell until all the
vast and desolate scene seemed to bend and listen. The
notes might have been born of the peaks that looked as
if torn asunder by harsh unlovely hands, then softened
to beauty and gentleness by the silver glitter of the
snow. And the strains, piercing yet remote, had in
them too the eternal loneliness of the mountains, the only
thing in Nature akin to the eternal loneliness of the
great. The hills took up the echo and rolled it on, and
among far and hidden peaks a laugh seemed flying from
itself.</p>

<p>When they had finished, Zrinyi turned to Ranata.
“They have come here to see your Royal Highness,” he
said; “and not so much because you are our princess as
the sister of our lost crown prince. Have I your permission
to ask them to enter?”</p>

<p>Ranata, who was pale, turned paler. “Yes,” she
said. “Ask them in.”</p>

<p>The guests returned to the lower end of the hall, whence
the table had been removed, and threw off their cloaks.
The women made a brilliant group in their elaborate
dinner dress, their flowers and jewels and superfluous
fans.</p>

<p>The Wallachians and Roumanians—there are few of
Hungarian blood so far south in Transylvania—came
silently but eagerly in. Each man as he entered removed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
the tower of fur on his head, revealing a dark
mane of matted hair. The countenances thus exposed
were mild and often handsome, but the dark eyes burned
and flashed with an excitement of which they gave no
other evidence.</p>

<p>Ranata remained with the group until the incoming
throng had almost filled the hall. The doors were still
open, and behind the mass of heads on the platform she
could see the snowy slopes of the range, whose silences
seemed to have fallen upon the castle; no one spoke,
and the sandals of the mountaineers pressed the floor
silently. Zrinyi murmured a suggestion, and Ranata
ascended a few steps of the staircase which finished the
hall. All the voluptuous beauty had left her face; it
was so white that her eyes burned black. Her aspect
would have been angry had it been less stern. She
could not speak Roumanian, but Zrinyi had hastily
taught her a few words.</p>

<p>“I am the sister of your crown prince,” she said.
“And I am honored and happy that you have come to
see me.”</p>

<p>They gazed at her for a few moments in a heavier
silence. To them she had lost nothing of a beauty
they had never seen, and in the wavering lights, possibly
because at the moment her mind was face to face
with her brother, her likeness to Rudolf was so strong
as to send the blood to their heads. It rose slowly, for
they were cold with long waiting and taken by surprise
with a beauty they had not expected, but when they
realized that the sister of their prince and the chiefest
object of his affections stood before them, they suddenly
sent forth a mighty cry, hard, wild, abrupt. It was almost
a note of agony, such as the mountains might have
given when the fires of the earth boiled them apart. The
cry shot out again, but this time it swelled into volume,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
ended in a roar, and then split into intelligible sound.
“<i>Élyen!</i>” “<i>Setreasca!</i>” “<i>Setreasca!</i>” shook the old
flags like the wind of battle; then, on a higher note,
“Rudolf!” “Rudolf!” “Rudolf!” They came forward
like a great wave, excited, voluble, demanding to
be told what they had done to anger their prince that he
came no more, what his wicked enemies had done with
him, why his father, the great King and Emperor, was
hiding him. It was idle to attempt to answer, and
Ranata stood looking down upon them, at times forgetting
the strange scene, her thoughts in the crypt of the
Capuchin Church with her brother. Suddenly she heard
herself addressed in Hungarian, and glanced aside to
see a gypsy standing on the step below her. He was
regarding her with admiring eyes, but there was a sardonic
twinkle in them, and his mien although friendly
would not have inspired confidence in an idiot. However,
Ranata came forth from her thoughts and smiled
on him.</p>

<p>“Did you know him?” she asked.</p>

<p>He addressed her in the most extravagant forms of
homage, but when he answered her question it was with
directness enough.</p>

<p>“I was with his party on every visit,” he asserted
triumphantly, as if exhibiting a valued stock-in-trade;
“I and my band. He was always eager to hear the Chardash.
And out on Lake Zenoga, sometimes at Görgény,
we sat at his board, or in the circle by the fire. Oh,
those were the days, your Highness—first a prince, then
a gypsy, then a prince, then a gypsy, all mixed up, all
drunk, everybody happy. I know that Rudolf is dead,
for I have travelled far, but I wish he were not.”</p>

<p>The man’s speech broke through the severity of her
mood and she laughed. “I have no doubt they were
gay times,” she said, “and I regret that I am not a man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
to come and take his place among you. But I will do
the best I can; and believe that I shall love you as much
as he did.”</p>

<p>The man shook his head. “We would never dare to
love like that again.” He paused, then added meaningly,
“The love of the chosen Hapsburgs is fatal—to
themselves and to those who win it.”</p>

<p>Ranata looked over the man’s head as if he had disappeared
into the still shouting multitude; but he had
the assurance of his race, which acknowledges neither
country nor king, and he repeated:</p>

<p>“It is always fatal, your Royal Highness.”</p>

<p>Then Ranata looked down at him once more. After
all, the creature was not worth crushing, and he was
diverting. Moreover, he had known and doubtless been
spoiled by her brother. Rudolf had told her many
anecdotes of the gypsies who always attached themselves
to his Transylvanian household.</p>

<p>“You will not return to us!” continued the gypsy.
“When Rudolf left us the last time I said he would not
return. Nor did I predict it because he said to us not
‘<i>Aufwiedersehen</i>,’ but ‘<i>Good-bye</i>.’”</p>

<p>“Is that true?”</p>

<p>“It is true, but that was not the reason. When he
came that last time I said he would not return.”</p>

<p>“And how do you know I shall not return?”</p>

<p>“Because love is fatal to the chosen Hapsburgs, your
Royal Highness.”</p>

<p>“Then they can avoid love,” said the Archduchess
impersonally.</p>

<p>“Not when they are made for it. Nature has protected
many by a mask as ugly as the plague. When
she gives them beauty be sure it is to scourge the proudest
house on earth, and to chastise it for centuries of
cruelty and oppression.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>“Maria Theresia was beautiful.”</p>

<p>“She was fat. She also had more children than a
man ever can remember. Besides, she was not really
beautiful.”</p>

<p>“And you are not very logical. Other houses of
Europe have records for injustice as great as ours may
possibly have.”</p>

<p>“Nature has taken other methods to punish them.
Be sure that none shall escape.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you wish to tell my fortune. I have not
superstition enough for that, but in the name of my
brother I will send you a purse to the servants’ quarters
to-night.”</p>

<p>She withdrew into the polite silence with which royalty
lays down the burden of audience, but the gypsy held
his ground. He thanked her extravagantly, and added:
“I am more honest than most gypsies, your Royal
Highness—I do not pretend to see too far into the future.
But when a man’s heart is black with remorse and bitterness
and hatred of life and the reckless indulgence of
passions, I can see the end; and when a woman—”</p>

<p>“Go!” said Ranata; and this time the man mingled his
featureless sheepskin with the others. She beckoned to
Zrinyi and spoke with him a moment. Then he stood
beside her and lifted his hand. Every man seemed to
shut his voice between his teeth.</p>

<p>“Her Royal Highness wishes me to tell you,” said the
Count, on a note which carried to those beyond the door,
“that Rudolf is dead. That he has gone where you may
meet him again if you are faithful and loyal subjects
to the throne. She will tell you herself.”</p>

<p>And Ranata said in Roumanian, and with the cold accent
of finality, “He is dead.”</p>

<p>Zrinyi let the words sink into the silence, then he raised
his voice again and shouted that barrels of wine were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
opening in the kitchen, and the great wave turned upon
itself and rolled out, but still in silence and with many
a backward glance.</p>

<p>Ranata ascended the stairs. When she returned she
wore a short skirt and a long fur cloak with a hood.</p>

<p>“I am going for a walk,” she said to the astonished
company. “Mr. Abbott, will you come with me?” Then
to the Princess Sarolta, who had risen, she added, “No
power can prevent me. But do not be alarmed; I shall
return.”</p>

<p>“Do you give me your royal word for that?” asked
the alarmed Obersthofmeisterin, “otherwise, old and
lame as I am, I shall follow you.”</p>

<p>“I give you my word. You may sleep in peace.”</p>

<div class="chapter">

</div>

<p>Fessenden and Ranata walked rapidly and in silence
over the paths the mountain peasants had trodden that
night. There had been neither wind nor snow for many
days, and what had fallen was compact and not too
smooth for impatient feet. For a time the path was
straight, and, looking back, the irregular mass of the
castle on its isolated rock was the one dark object in the
white radiance of the Alpine world. Soon, however, a
sharp turn about the foot of one of the peaks that rose
straight from the brief level seemed to fling them abruptly
into an eternity of ice-fields and endless chains of
glittering crests so high above that their fierce teeth
must surely bite new pictures into the moon that hung
so close. Ranata’s arm was within his, but Fessenden’s
mind reverted to his boyhood in the Adirondacks, when
he had stolen forth to his balcony on winter moonlight
nights to gaze upon the snowy lake and peaks, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
dream of their kin in the far-off Alps. How tame
that picture seemed to-night, dear as it was! That
was a mild and pleasant wilderness compared with this
upper firmament of ice and desolation, with its black
forests below and on high its masses of rock and crag
that looked as if arrested in brutal warfare with each
other.</p>

<p>In the course of an hour the path came abruptly to an
end on the shore of a small lake, from three sides of
which the mountains rose like the straight and jealous
sides of a mighty jewel casket guarding the diamond
treasure of some old god of the hills. The lake, looking
smaller perhaps from the great height of the perpendicular
mountains surrounding it, was oval in shape, and
its frozen surface glittered and sparkled under the moon
poised directly above. No light of man had ever drawn
such radiance from the diamond. The air was so still
that the cold was hardly noticeable. The silence was
intense, oppressive, now that their feet no longer met
the snow crisply. Ranata put her hand nervously to
her head.</p>

<p>“What are you thinking of?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Of my boyhood in the Adirondacks. To-night a
thousand years seem to have disappeared since then.
And many and wild as were my dreams of the future in
those callow days when I had leisure for dreams, no flight
penetrated to the future which held these last weeks, to
the indescribable solitude of this night with you. In
those days I fancied myself a poor boy who had begun
life in the orthodox log-cabin and must end in the White
House. But that I should love a daughter of the
Cæsars and hold her in my arms among the eternal snows
of the loneliest of the Alps never muttered in my most
exalted moments. Life is a rum thing.”</p>

<p>Ranata laughed in spite of the chaotic emotions that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
had driven her forth. “Which do you really love best, I
wonder, the sublime or the ridiculous? Do you know
what I had almost made up my mind to do when I came
down to dinner?”</p>

<p>“To go to-morrow with me to Fiume?”</p>

<p>“To-night; as soon as the others were out of the way,
and Zrinyi could have the horses harnessed. After I
left you there was an hour in which I think I really was
mad. Every fact of existence except the possibility of
being alone with you on your yacht seemed to have been
burned out of my mind. I would have sold Austria to
William, I would have flung Hungary to Roumania—there
was no crime I would not have committed to have
been alone on this earth with you. And now we are
alone, and the fever is gone. I look back upon the hours
before those poor creatures came and shouted Rudolf’s
name as upon some half-remembered interval of insanity.
But it was appallingly real then, and if it came
once it may come again. After our return to Budapest—and
I shall start to-morrow—I shall never see you
again.”</p>

<p>“I still think you are unwise not to take advantage of
this opportunity. You will regret it; take my word
for that.”</p>

<p>“Doubtless, when it is happily too late. I am ice now.
I can only describe my sensation while those wild men
were begging me for Rudolf by asking you to imagine
yourself standing under that frozen cascade over there.
It seemed to me that for the first time I realized the
enormity of his crime. He could have been a great
monarch, he could have preserved his country, he could
have saved Europe from unimaginable horrors; and
every gift, every duty, every ambition disappeared into
the flaming abyss of his passions. Oh, if my father
could only have died twenty years ago! That alone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
could have saved Rudolf, for it was excess that killed
him; the occasional indulgence would not have mattered.
And these men, and thousands like them, would have
obeyed his lightest call to save Austria from Europe,
to save it from Hungary if need be. They would come
at my call. They would laugh even at my father.
And, Fessenden, above those wild heads, and bodies
like mountain beasts, I saw for a moment the pale
face of Rudolf, terrible with agony and remorse, with
impotent resentment against the law of the grave,
dumbly beseeching me to continue the work that the
great invisible forces up there had sent him into the
world to accomplish. It was then that my blood
turned to ice. An hour before—and in other moments,
perhaps—I had been capable of greater guilt than
Rudolf’s; for after all I have had no such temptations,
no such provocations as his. Where you have upheld
me, women, from the time he was old enough, the
very girls of the court, flung themselves beneath his feet,
honored to be dishonored by the heir to the throne,
even had he been less fascinating as a man. My father
had made no secret of his own amours; there has been
no more corrupt court in Europe; Rudolf saw no
necessity for restraint, and he used none. If he had
married happily all might have been well, for he was not
vicious, and his nature was very affectionate. But when
does royalty marry happily? Fortunate the prince who
marries the cow. Then at least there is one incentive
the less. Rudolf had no such fortune, and disappointment
and <i>ennui</i>, multiplying themselves, drove him to
the arms of charming women who wished for nothing
so much as to make him forget, and from them to the
boon companions who adored him, but dared not
remonstrate had they wished, when he drank till
morning. But what excuse had I? Only that of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
passion so great and so real that it should give me the
strength of these mountains. Without it, after gaining
my wishes in Hungary, I might have become bored,
indifferent, cynical; I might even, as I felt youth passing,
have indulged in amours that no one would dare to
take me to account for. I might have gone to my
coffin there in the Kaisergruft without an ideal in my
soul, disillusioned, all my original nature in ruins, reviling
life, glad to die. Now it seems to me that after
the inevitable agony is over, I have it in me to become
really great in character, sustained by an inner life and
fed by a memory that will keep me young till my death.
I thought of this long ago, when I met you first, but it
passed from my mind. It was more like a dream then.
I know it to be a reality now. I doubt if there can be
any such actual happiness as what I shall find in the
memories of you.”</p>

<p>Fessenden looked at her long and intently. If she
was of many and variable moods, the moods were of an
intensity and truth which submerged the other women in
her while they lasted. And he always responded to her
deeper moments so fully and so involuntarily that only
his ever-alert brain saved him from compromising his
future conduct. As in the profoundest solitude he had
ever known, he looked through her eyes into her naked
soul, he had a long moment of doubt. In that cold ideal
of fulfilled duty, with her love apotheosized and
spiritualized, might she not in truth be happier than he
could make her? Her state, and the more commonplace
cause of the deep chill of an Alpine midnight, had
cooled his own blood, and muffled the passionate voices
in his imagination. For a moment he too felt the

striving after spiritual heights, and compensates for the
voluntary resignation of the joy of love. He darted
a glance upward and was visited by a brief illusion:
he and Ranata stood alone on the highest peak that
pierced the stars. Then like Life he compromised.</p>

<p>“I wish for nothing less than your full and unconditional
surrender,” he said. “If, when you have
had time to know yourself better than you do now, you
tell me that your decision is unalterable, I will persist
no further. I believe that you will send for me before
long, but I may be mistaken. Perhaps I have been
blinded by my love, and the hopes with which it has
inspired my imagination. There may be, there are, of
course, depths in your mind of which I have no conception.
These may contain forces that will finally
shut me out of your life. If you convince me that I
should add to your unhappiness by persisting, or that
I should do you a great wrong by making you mine
in spite of yourself, then I promise you here solemnly
to withdraw finally from your life; and to be as eternally
faithful to you as I believe you will be to me.”</p>

<p>Vilma from her high window saw them return. She
had watched for them, not from the motive which had
made her neighbor walk restlessly between her window
and her writing-table, but in tempestuous sympathy with
a romance against which she pressed so close. Her own
heart she believed to be a graveyard with one tomb, and
she found a vicarious happiness in this atmosphere of
passionate and uncommon love that she was graciously
permitted to enter. She had seen how it was from the
first, and had done what she could to divert the attentions
and the suspicion of Piroska. Pumping had had
no effect on the wary Zápolya, and Vilma, with all her
subtlety, was still in doubt as to what the possible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
enemy may have seen or suspected. She had followed
Fessenden and Ranata on the night of the ball, and
waited without the door leading to the private apartments
until she heard him returning; that she might
be able to assure Piroska she had been their companion
and chaperon. But Piroska had given no sign
that she had been occupied during that brilliant night
except with her many partners, and Vilma dared not tell
Ranata what she had done. Gracious and captivating
as the Princess was in her new rôle, it would have been
a braver than Vilma who would have taken a liberty
with her. Fessenden possessed no great charm for this
young Hungarian, who preferred a more romantic type,
but if he had inspired love in her beautiful princess she
wished with all her heart that he too were of the blood
of kings. Had these two been content with intrigue she
would willingly have helped and shielded them, but she
shrewdly suspected the truth. Astounding as the fact
might be, the American wished to marry the daughter of
an emperor and king. It took the ancient pattern of
her brain a long while to adjust itself to the bare idea, but
when time had accustomed her to its audacity she could,
starved soul that she was, but sympathize. She too had
had an intuition of Ranata’s state of mind when she
bloomed upon them at dinner that night, breathing
passion and defiance, and she heartily wished the Princess
had slipped out of the castle with her lover instead of
giving her word to the Obersthofmeisterin to return.</p>

<p>She had also overheard the words of Piroska to the
American, and she had noted that the moment the
Princess left the castle the sister lady-in-waiting had
pleaded the morning toothache and gone to her room. It
adjoined Vilma’s, and for two hours the friend had
listened to the steady scratching of the enemy’s pen,
interrupted only by hasty visits to the window. Vilma<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
had lived close enough to Piroska during these months
of court life to be sure she did not keep a diary. She
was now fully convinced that she was the tool of
Königsegg for two reasons: it was worth her while, and
she had intended to marry the American when he
became convinced of the hopelessness of his suit.
Piroska’s wiles had been patent enough if her hostility
had not, and to-night, as the American had turned
to her with an air of conclusion and six words which
might have extinguished hope in a more sanguine heart,
the hard little face of Piroska had settled into lines
of malice and determination. She had been as gay as
usual during the dinner, but the color had come back
neither to cheek nor lips, and Vilma suspected that if
the unfortunate lovers had flown that night Piroska
would have managed to follow them as far as the first
telegraph station. Now, no doubt, she was writing
her long-deferred report.</p>

<p>As Vilma watched Ranata and Fessenden return, she
slipped from the window-seat and climbed onto the bed,
still huddled in her furs. The fire was out and the room
almost cold, but she could not prepare for sleep knowing
of the plot thickening in the next room. The hour had
come to act, but what should she do? To attempt to
intercept Piroska’s letter on the morrow would be futile;
Piroska would see to that. Vilma did her justice; there
would be no loose ends, as in novels, for the good fairy to
unravel. Should she walk boldly in and hurl suspicion
in her face? Vilma was too European to approve of
the crude method. The wild idea occurred to her of
smothering Piroska with a pillow as she slept, but she
had a certain measure of common-sense; a tragedy in the
royal household would put an end to court life in Buda
for the present, perhaps thwart ambitions she half
suspected, possibly send herself to keep company with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
Piroska. She dismissed with some reluctance the idea
she was quite capable of executing, and suddenly
determined to go into Piroska’s room and be guided by
events. She left the bed and knocked on the connecting
door; then, assuming that she had been answered,
opened it and entered.</p>

<p>“I cannot sleep,” she said, “and I heard you moving
about, so I thought you might be as glad of company as
I. You are writing? How can you in this cold? Do
you know I sat up to watch them come home? Not
that I doubted they would, but I felt as if I were
living in a chapter of romantic memoirs. I may write
mine some day—but you should do that—you are so
much cleverer than I.”</p>

<p>Piroska had risen politely and pushed a chair slightly
away from her table. She had a small pile of manuscript
before her, which she had the presence of mind
not to attempt to conceal. “I <i>am</i> cold,” she said, stifling
a yawn, “and tired. But I could not go to bed.
The excitement of the evening made me hopelessly wide
awake, so I thought I would write my long-neglected
letters.”</p>

<p>“It has been exciting—those wild simple creatures!
But that looks like a book. Tell me—” her eyes were
bright with girlish curiosity, “<i>are</i> you writing a novel?
You could! Ah! I know you are!”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Piroska, with a delicate hesitation, “I—for
Heaven’s sake don’t breathe it, Vilma! One is such
a fool until one succeeds!”</p>

<p>Vilma gave an ecstatic cry, and with a movement as
swift and unexpected as that of a panther flung herself
upon the mass of papers. “Let me see! Let me see!”
she cried. But they were torn from her hands and the
eyes that met hers blazed with the ferocity of a less
civilized century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>“You dare!” gasped Piroska—“you dare!”</p>

<p>Vilma had seen enough. “Oh, very well,” she said
haughtily. “I had no idea a book was like a tiger’s
cub. It made me quite wild with curiosity, and I am
sorry we tore the manuscript. Good-night. I would
not sit up and copy it if I were you. Your tooth will
be quite frightful to-morrow.”</p>

<p>She swept out, and locked the door as she closed it.
Piroska, too, might be capable of using a pillow. She
took down a candlestick and let herself noiselessly into
the hall. It was very dark, except for the patches of
ghostly moonlight; but commonplace fears were unknown
to this girl of fighting ancestors, of women who
had suffered worse than death. She knew that the
men’s rooms were in the opposite wing, and she traversed
the long corridors between without adventure or
qualm. When she reached the wing she saw light under
two doors; Zrinyi had undoubtedly sat up to await the
return of the Princess. Which was the American’s door
she had no means of knowing, but she did not hesitate.
If her knock summoned Zrinyi she would tell
him that she had a message for his guest which must
be delivered then. It brought Fessenden, however,
and she stepped quickly into his room and closed the
door.</p>

<p>He did not look as astonished as she had expected,
but she told her story breathlessly and begged him to act
at once.</p>

<p>“It will do no good to intercept the report,” she added.
“Even if you could, she would merely write another.
But let me go to the Princess and beg her to fly with you
to-morrow early. We could shut Piroska up for twenty-four
hours. If you do not take this opportunity you
will never have another. Her Royal Highness must have
many enemies at court. This will be the final straw. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
she is forced to return to Vienna you will never see her
again.”</p>

<p>“I wish that report to go to Vienna to-morrow,” said
Fessenden, “and if you are not too tired to sit down for
a few moments, I will tell you how you can help
when she is once more in the Hofburg.”</p>

</div>

<p>Two nights after her return Ranata went to the opera-house
of Budapest for the last time. Much to her chagrin
she was ten minutes late. Royalty has its privileges
and virtues. It may exercise the courtesy of
promptness without loss of prestige, and no men and
women the world over sit in an opera-box with the same
ease and dignity and grace. From childhood they are
trained to stand and sit without moving or betraying
fatigue, and if the frequent necessity adds to the sum of
their mortal expiations, it makes them as decorative,
when properly dressed, as their ancient palaces and historical
pageants.</p>

<p>But for one princess the tenor of the day had been
disturbed. A sleepless night had resulted in an involuntary
nap at three o’clock in the afternoon. Her drive
had been late, and she had returned home so short a
time before the early dinner that her maids had detained
her through half of it. She regretted having announced
her intention to attend the opera, but it was a <i>première</i>,
and she would have been expected in any case.</p>

<p>The large house was crowded with the gay aristocracy
of Budapest, and with many who, if not so highly
placed, could dress as well, and contribute to the general
effect of brilliant beauty: an effect which owed more
than the women would have admitted to the varied and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
magnificent uniforms of the officers. Orders glittered
on black coats as on colored, and every woman wore her
abundant store of jewels. But fans and heads were
moving restlessly. Where was their princess? It was
the <i>première</i> in Hungary of Massenet’s “Le Jongleur de
Notre Dame,” and this music-loving people were eager
for the curtain to rise.</p>

<p>At ten minutes past seven that mysterious electric
current that announces the coming of royalty to the
sensitive faculties of Europeans flew over the house;
bringing it to its feet, and lifting its eyes to the gala box
facing the stage, as if manipulated by a spring.</p>

<p>Ranata, accompanied by Sarolta and Alexandra, her
Grand Chamberlain, Prince Illehazy, and Count Zrinyi,
entered and advanced to the front of the box, acknowledging
the waving of handkerchiefs and clapping of hands,
the well-bred “<i>Élyens</i>” and “<i>Vivats</i>” and “<i>Hochs</i>.”
She wore white velvet, a small crown of pearls, and
many pearls on her neck. For the first time she showed
the wear of too much thought and loss of sleep; she was
pale rather than white, and her eyes were listless. During
the few moments that she stood there, however,
while the band played the national anthem, her guests
on either side of her, the admiring house saw only the
perfect carriage of her form and head, the undimmed
brilliancy of her hair, and that most rare combination
of beauty and majesty.</p>

<p>The anthem finished, the royal party took their seats,
the opera began. Ranata kept her eyes resolutely bent
upon the stage, but although she felt and had been severely
drilled in music, hers was the imagination which
escapes control under the influence of the only art that
penetrates to the key-notes of being. The spell of the
limpid semi-religious music swirled round her like a soft
tide. She saw far beyond the poor juggler apologizing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
to the Virgin for desecrating her name that he might
gratify a heartless rabble and keep his wretched body
from starving; and if she forbade her eyes to wander over
the house, every nerve told her that Fessenden Abbott
was not there.</p>

<p>She had asked him to leave Hungary immediately
upon his return to Budapest, and she knew that if he
had not done so—he must await important telegrams—he
would not come to the palace, nor to any gathering
where she was sure to be. And to attend the opera except
in her train would have excited the comment both
wished to avoid.</p>

<p>Whether he had gone or not she did not know, for she
would not ask Alexandra; if indeed her friend knew, for
the brother and sister had said good-bye at the station
in Budapest. Ranata, who had been gifted with no
greater measure of consistency than the rest of her sex,
had hoped to see him while driving, while entering the
opera-house, to receive from him some swift involuntary
token that he was thinking of her as persistently as
she was of him.</p>

<p>For she thought of little else, and she was aghast at
the power of love to defy the will. The emotional
struggle had induced a physical lassitude she had never
known before. That morning she had risen with the
thought, “Am I going to send for him to-day? Am I?
<i>Am I?</i>” And the question had risen again and again,
acquainting her for the first time with the insolent defiance
of the fixed idea to the higher qualities of the
brain. She had had experience of the dual entity in the
mental household before, but never so complete a sense
of division, nor of possession by faculties which seemed
to have forced an entrance into her mind rather than
have risen from its depths.</p>

<p>She had not sent for him, however, and she hardly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
knew whether she had refrained through the exercise of
a will which appeared to sit in a corner smiling with
amusement, from pride, a sense of futility, or merely
because the argument in her mind had not finished in
time. In any case she felt so far from her imperious
self that she was almost as alarmed as she was unhappy.
She was filled with a dull abhorrence of the idea of living
the rest of her life on the surface of her nature, as
she was attempting to live it to-night. For what else
was left her? Did she become queen, and none knew
better than she that it was but a possibility among a
thousand opposing forces, she could occupy her brain
with routine as her father did; but in a constitutional
monarchy, particularly in one as jealous of its rights as
Hungary, she would exercise so little power that, with
her merciless clarity of vision, she must soon know herself
for what she was, an ornamental figure-head. It
would be the pride of the Hungarians to have the most
beautiful queen in Europe, delight the abundant enthusiasm
and the loyal instinct of their natures to love
their elected sovereign; and they would value her the
more for a charm which must unite all factions and preserve
them from internal conflict. They would vote
her immense sums to live as a queen should, to restore
to the old palace of Buda its ancient glories and excite
the envy of Europe. All these things she might have,
and she knew them to be toys.</p>

<p>Did she sympathize with the tide of liberty rising in
the world, and nowhere so vigorously as in Hungary?
She had put the question from her again and again, and
it had returned as often. Surely he had not revolutionized
her brain to that extent; she must be less than
herself were she unfaithful to the monarchical idea.
And yet, when her mind left Fessenden Abbott it seemed
to her that some mysterious force drew it to the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
sullen heart of mankind, brooding eternally on its birthright
of freedom; every instinct of independence, when
not crushed by the tyranny of the Turk or the Russian,
still blunted and pruned in a thousand petty and humiliating
ways. Would the socialists conquer William?
And then—when with greater liberty had come their
own adaptation to the unalterable facts of life and human
nature—would the world be better, a more habitable
place for mankind in the general? And was that the
destiny of the human race—the happiness of the many,
not the exaltation of the few? That it was a great
thought, a grand theory, she did not pretend to deny.
But did she sympathize with it?</p>

<p>While she assured herself contemptuously that she
did not, that the order of the centuries must be best merely
because it was, a part of her brain seemed to her to
accept the doctrine, and give itself no concern to argue.
She turned her back upon it. Why argue, indeed? A
month, a few months hence, possibly a year, the influence
that now possessed her would be so far removed that her
mind would have recovered its balance, alien thoughts
must have sunk so deep that she would only unearth
them now and again as curiosities. She made up her
mind that if Alexandra did not marry Zrinyi she would
put an end to the intimacy with herself; and it seemed
to her, in her present unhappy condition, that she would
be insensible to further sorrow. She should indeed
welcome complete loneliness, barren of outward suggestion.
There could be no doubt of the triumph, in
time, of her strong will, of her absolute fidelity, in
thought as in deed, to the lofty station to which she had
been born.</p>

<p>She sighed for her lost superstitions, rather for the
superstitions of her fathers which might have been here
had no alien influence entered her life. How they must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
sustain the soul of majesty through its trials, through
its loneliness, through the long martyrdom of its earthly
course. There had been times when she had heard the
deep mutter of those ancient ghosts, when for a brief
hour they had risen and possessed her brain. Indeed,
there had been hours—usually when Alexandra’s uncompromising
practicality summered in its native land—when
it had seemed to her that in the depths of her
soul was a charnel-house of hideous memories, ambiguous
of outline, of old corruptions, unknown in her life but
transmitted with her blood, of impulses for tyranny
and cruelty, and unbridled passions, of lust of blood,
and callous indifference to human suffering. Philip the
Second and Joan the Mad were but two of her illustrious
ancestors who might have sent filtering down the worst
traits and impulses which the human heart is capable
of supporting. There had been times when she had believed
that had she been born a century earlier it would
have needed but the circumstances to make her the
vilest of women. She could have reigned with her feet
in blood and loved as royal harlots have loved since
Messalina burned her pitch in history. And, she recalled,
as she listened to the soft passionless music of
the opera, there had also been moments when she had
regretted that no such life could be hers—wondered if
indeed it had not been.</p>

<p>But it was years now since the last of these obsessions
had risen, five or six, at least. She had acquired great
control over herself; moreover, they had rested impotent
under healthy influences; and assuredly in the company
of Fessenden Abbott she could not have evoked their
memory, the ghosts of those old ghosts. Would it not
perhaps be better if she could? Would not even the
occasional demoralization of her spiritual nature be a
lesser sin than this treachery to the divinity in her royal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
blood? Were she steeped in superstition she might
have known her lover better than she had; but the
temptation to marry him, the persistent disposition to
look at life from his point of view, would never have assailed
her for a moment.</p>

<p>Her eyes during this long reverie, interrupted only
by an <i>entr’acte</i>, were fixed upon the stage. The surface
of her brain had taken its impression of the interior of
the monastery where the starving mountebank, cursed
by the prior for his blasphemy, had been enticed that
he might find absolution in the life of a monk and fill
his stomach daily. The priests and friars in their rich
white cassocks, the brown interior of the monastic room,
made a harmonious and insidious picture, and the despair
of the miserable youth while the other cenobites
boasted of the arts—painting, sculpture, poetry, music—with
which they glorified the Virgin, drew tears from
many sympathetic eyes.</p>

<p>The juggler and a kindly friar were alone, and the
elect was pouring into the astonished ear of the poor
ignoramus the story of the birth of Christ in a manger,
and explaining that the Lady of Sorrows understood
not only Latin, but all languages, and even dialects, and
had as merciful an ear for the outcast as for the king.
The mountebank, with his primitive credulity, his almost
maniacal terror under the curse of the abbot, is a vivid
study of superstition in the Middle Ages. As Ranata’s
attention was captured for the moment by the intensity
of the final moments of the act, she found herself envying
the simplicity of a creature as capable, in his primal
limitations, of the extremest satisfaction and happiness
as of terror and despair. The second <i>entr’acte</i> is very
short. A few moments after the curtain rises the impressive
double row of friars in their sumptuous cassocks
march out of the chapel to their own solemn music,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
and the mountebank enters alone, throws off his
monastic robe, and in his costume of a harlequin offers
his juggler’s art to the glorification of the painted Virgin
above the altar. It is a scene almost incredible in its
childish superstition, but so pathetic that in that rapt
audience neither Jew nor Protestant paid his brain the
tribute of a smile. Ranata, of all persons, saw no humor
in it, for her mind traversed the history of her
race, and halted suddenly at the memory of Maria
Theresia, who had sent her daughters down alone into
the imperial crypt on the eve of their marriage to pray
among the coffins of their ancestors. She recalled how
she herself had sometimes felt an impulse to go down
there in the night and do likewise, that she might satisfy
that something in the depths of her soul so akin to those
who had dwelt in the benighted past.</p>

<p>Her attitude suddenly lost its graceful ease. She
stiffened and sat erect as if about to spring; but the
eye of the house was focussed on the stage and she was
forgotten. Was not the time come for that nocturnal
pilgrimage? Might not she there, among those four
centuries of her dead, steep herself in that subtle aura
of personality which still must diffuse itself through lead
and bronze? Alone there, at midnight, with but the light
of a taper to illumine those motley hillocks, with the
dank odor of death clogging her senses, kneeling close
to the dust and the corruption which had lived so intensely
with the blood that ran in her own veins, must
she not recapture her inherited superstitions, break with
the present, absorb once more the poison of the past?
She realized that it was not to satisfy her sense of kinship
with the dead that she should now go to them alone
at midnight, but to revive the lost sense of indissoluble
relationship, of similarities, of the closest likeness of
which inherited blood and brain-cells are capable. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
should kneel finally at the foot of Rudolf’s coffin, and
pray there until she was a Hapsburg once more.</p>

<p>Heavy and abnormal as her brain was from fatigue,
sleeplessness, passionate misery of thought, and reaction
from the exalted mood of her last interview with
Fessenden, still it seemed to her that it drew away in
modern disgust from the idea that had risen precipitately
in its middle and taken possession. But
Ranata clung to that idea as to her one hope of salvation;
and as the Virgin and the angels, which had appeared in
place of the picture above the altar, to reveal the
eternal beauty of simple faith to the indignant priests,
were growing more luminous, and at the same time,
so perfect the art, less and less material, and the poor
juggler’s spirit was struggling from its flesh, she matured
the details of her plan; and half an hour later, when she
descended from the carriage in the palace court-yard,
she asked Sarolta to be ready to accompany her to
Vienna on the following day.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

</div>

<p>Fessenden had found his telegrams awaiting him, and
started at once for Berlin. While the ghosts in Ranata
were chuckling their recognition to the painted superstitions
of the stage, he was in the royal palace, in
the comfortable English-looking study overlooking the
Schlossplatz. On the north corner of the huge brown
pile floated the purple banner which informs the people
of Berlin that their “Travelling Kaiser” is visiting at
home.</p>

<p>The Emperor was pleasurably at home this evening,
for, although he was too much of a soldier to lounge, he
wore a smoking-jacket and sat deep in one of his English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
chairs; the color of animation was in his pale face, and
his eyes, always expressive and brilliant, sparkled with a
more personal emotion.</p>

<p>It was night. His courtiers, his ministers, his generals,
his supplicants, were on the other side of the door,
and he could be wholly himself for an hour with the
one man who neither feared nor flattered him, to whom
he had given a large portion of his own warm affections,
and who, in return, gave him the sincerest friendship he
would ever know.</p>

<p>Fessenden’s chair was drawn close to the fire, and he
was sipping a Scotch-and-soda. It was a night for a
comfortable talk in a warm bright room, surrounded
by books and a man’s more intimate belongings; for
the wind howled about the corner of the palace and
dashed the rain against the glass. Fessenden’s eyes
were sparkling also, but with excitement, and he was
more nervous than he usually permitted his manner to
betray.</p>

<p>“Within a week,” the Emperor was saying, “the Archduchess
will be summoned to Vienna on one pretence or
another. The plan is to make her a prisoner in her own
rooms until she promises to marry the Archduke Aloys
Franz. I suggested him on account of his commanding
qualities as a disciplinarian; you will recall that they
married the Princess Marie Stefanie to him when her
liaison with her tenor was discovered. He imprisoned
her on one of his estates, never permitted her to leave it
for a day, and when she lost a front tooth mortified her
vanity by refusing her the services of a dentist—she was
a beauty, poor little thing! As a husband for refractory
princesses he is without a peer; and my indirect suggestion
met with instant favor from the Emperor, who is
distracted between the jealousies of the court and the
new motive for disturbance in the caldron of Hungary.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
The full information—furnished by the maid of honor
and other spies—of her love for you was the last straw;
and much as the Emperor loves peace and quiet, when
the moment comes to act he acts. The Archduchess,
of course, will not marry Aloys Franz. We know her;
elaboration of that statement is superfluous. But
several weeks of solitary meditation will probably convince
her that, as her ambitions are thwarted, she may
as well marry you and be happy. Confinement will
reduce her to an abnormal state, where love will seem
the only object for living.”</p>

<p>He left his chair and moved restlessly about the room.
“I don’t like it!” he announced in his harsh emphatic
voice. “It is unheard of. It is a dangerous precedent.
We shall have other dissatisfied and romantic princesses
following her example. Take one stone out of the
monarchical edifice and it is impossible to foresee the
end. God knows, we are shaky enough now. I tell you
frankly, Fessenden, that I should assist in no such
revolution solely out of friendship for even you; but to
get her out of Europe is the less of two evils. I have
been called the trigger of Europe. She is the firebrand
charged with dynamite. She was dangerous enough
before. Now that she has fallen in love, the only thing
to do is to marry her to the object as quickly as possible.
Balked, and thrown in upon herself, she would set
Europe in flames merely to distract her mind and
gratify some other passion.” He swung round abruptly
and laughed. “I must say, Fessenden, that while I
am delighted to be able to help you get the woman
you want, I don’t envy you. I shouldn’t say she was
the sort of woman a man could settle down and have
a comfortable time with.”</p>

<p>“I want nothing more nor less,” said Fessenden; and
the Emperor laughed again, although his generous nature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
was gratified at the opportunity to be of service to
his friend.</p>

<p>“It will be rather more than less,” he said. “I have
known her since childhood, and while I admire her more
in certain respects than any woman living, I am not
precisely blind to her faults. I will confess that I shook
her once, a good many years ago, when I was visiting
Rudolf, and that she bit and scratched me in return.
However, the one man can always manage the woman
of strong passions, so I wish you joy.”</p>

<p>“Thanks; and don’t let my domestic prospects worry
you. Are you perfectly sure of your man, by the way?”</p>

<p>“Oh, perfectly. He has the ear of the Emperor and
the Crown Prince, and, while by no means false to them,
is so good a friend of mine that he would do more than
that if I asked it of him. Moreover, he has the confidence
of Königsegg.”</p>

<p>“Suppose they should suspect that you put him up
to it? That would ruin everything. They are quite
as afraid of you as they are of her.”</p>

<p>“No diplomat in Europe is more discreet—or finer in
his methods. He has dropped the poison by degrees.
His first references to the astonishing popularity of the
Archduchess in Hungary were almost inadvertent, and
at the same time accompanied with enthusiastic comments
upon her talents. Her conquest of the Independents
was the last straw. The Emperor has been
convinced that they would proclaim her queen the
moment he died. Was it your suggestion that they
met her in a body at the train when she arrived from
Transylvania?”</p>

<p>“I put Molnár and one or two others up to it, although
they are quite convinced it was their own
idea.”</p>

<p>“I am thankful you are my friend, for I shouldn’t want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
your finger in my political pie! Well, Ranata will never
see Budapest after this week—if you are quick enough.
If she should devil the poor old Emperor into his grave
while he was trying to bring her to terms, I should not
venture to answer for the consequences. What is your
next move? I see no further. How shall you get her
out of the Hofburg? Bribe the guards? It will be
difficult. The Emperor will guard her well. She could
hardly disguise herself and slip out. How shall you
manage to communicate with her?”</p>

<p>“Do not exercise your imagination over possibilities
of escape, for I have no idea of attempting any. I
intend to marry her with the Emperor’s consent. Not
very graciously given, perhaps, but still—”</p>

<p>“Oh, Fessenden!” The Emperor spoke impatiently.
He had paused on the hearth-rug, and stood there with
his left hand resting lightly on his hip, the familiar sword-hilt
being absent, the right gesticulating slightly, with
a constant movement of the wrist and an occasional
pointing of the index finger. “That, my dear boy,” he
added kindly, “is just the one thing that even you cannot
accomplish. That you will get the Archduchess
sooner or later I have no doubt. When a woman like
that loves a man—” He shot his hand up expressively.
“It may be that I shall have an inspiration of some sort
and help you further, but I cannot act openly or I would
invite her here. But I have every faith in your resource.”</p>

<p>“You will have more when I tell you my plan.”</p>

<p>The Emperor’s keen eyes met his, and they measured
each other as they had a habit of doing.</p>

<p>“Well?” asked the Emperor of Germany.</p>

<p>Fessenden stood up and thrust his hands into
pockets. His nervousness had gone, and his eyes were
hard and brilliant. “What do you suppose the Emperor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>
would give to restore the ancient strength and prestige of
Austria?” he asked, in the cool and even tones he employed
in his Wall Street offices. “To obliterate the
memory of 1866? To finish his long and unhappy reign
gloriously?”</p>

<p>“What on earth are you driving at? I never heard
you talk at random before.”</p>

<p>“You have never heard me talk at random. What
would he give in return for such a certainty?”</p>

<p>“More than Ranata. But I hate riddles!” His eyes
flashed. The blood burned his cheek. He knew Fessenden,
and was sure that he was not listening to bombast.
His curiosity and impatience nearly choked him.
“Come! Come!” he said. “What idea have you in
your head? After South America I am prepared for
anything. If you were not such a good fellow I should
hate you—but go on.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps what all the world most wants next to the
fulfilment of its personal desires,” continued Fessenden
imperturbably, “is the obliteration of its most actively
malignant forces. The most malignant force in the
world to-day is Russia; in a lesser degree, Turkey.
These countries, by their unredeemable barbarism, compass
the utter misery of more millions of helpless human
beings than all the other causes in the rest of the world
that conduce, in the natural order of things, to unhappiness.
Moreover, Russia is the one menace which
prevents Europe and England from enjoying a moment’s
security. She creeps and creeps, and never retraces a
step. In far-sightedness Russia is the greatest genius
among nations, and she is absolutely unscrupulous;
the tyro in diplomacy does not trust her, and yet she
outwits again and again. There is a hideous possibility
of her eventual triumph, and the day she weakens the
power of England, puts her nose in the Persian Gulf,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
flows over Turkey, that day sounds the passing bell of
modern civilization. Therefore, the power or powers
that hamstring this anomaly in the twentieth century,
forcing her to crouch with her feet in the sand like a
malignant but helpless sphinx until invading progress
has taught her wisdom—these powers would achieve
an immortality in history which they could compass by
means of no other modern conditions. Am I not right?”</p>

<p>The Emperor nodded. He was very pale. Not only
had Fessenden pricked from its drugged sleep one of the
passionate hopes of his early manhood, but he knew that
the American was no idle dreamer, that he had already
accomplished the impossible. He had a sensation of
standing spellbound on the threshold of a miraculous
future towards which the great forces within him had
moved precisely since the birth of the worlds. But
the impression was hardly realized; his faculties were concentrated
upon the utterance of the man who no longer
looked young, in whose aspect was no trace of the lover
of the Archduchess of Austria, who, indeed, looked
little more than an intellect, using a casual body as a
convenient medium. Abbott asked his next question so
abruptly that the Emperor stiffened into an attitude
not unlike that of a midnight sentry alarmed by a sudden
footfall.</p>

<p>“You know what I have been trying to do in my
factory out West?”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“The experiments are perfected. The kites—and they
are as beautiful as they are deadly—can be sent by electricity
to an incalculable distance, and each one will rain
down dynamite enough to kill a thousand men at a time
if they are close enough together. The generators to
charge storage batteries have, by other experiments,
been so reduced in size and weight that they hardly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>
count among the effects of a travelling army. The
enemy could be routed in ten minutes. Even balloons
are not necessary, except for reconnoitring. You also
know of the other invention, no less important. That
is perfected. The steel forts are not only impregnable,
but the secret has been discovered of moving electrically
operated machines over any sort of ground.
So far, moving forts, bicycles, automobiles have been
useless except on good roads. These forts will travel
without so much as a lowering of speed over the worst
that nature has to offer; there is even an apparatus, on
the principles of the flying-machine, which will carry
them over swamps and rivers. Do you see my drift?”</p>

<p>The Emperor’s face would have looked like wax but
for the severity of its lines. “Good God!” he muttered
finally. “If this is true it will make you the master of
the world.”</p>

<p>“It will make you the master of Europe.”</p>

<p>“What riddle now?” He spoke thickly, but involuntarily
twitched his shoulders. He was quick to resent
any attempt to manage him.</p>

<p>“The Spanish War has come and gone. I have no use
for these new weapons of war. They must be used at
once, for ideas are microbes. A few years hence—a year
hence—and the discoveries may be universal. If I had
never met Ranata I should have presented them to you
and told you to go ahead, and in the name of humanity
wipe Russia and Turkey, in the form they now exist, off
the map. I want to see you at the helm while you are
still young, and discouragements and disappointments
have not crushed all the enthusiasm out of you. The
world has waited and waited for you to do the great
thing, not realizing your difficulties, and that it was
your purpose to make Germany strong and prosperous
before launching it into a great war; your crusade will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
be looked upon as quite in keeping with your character.
And you are the only man on this side of the water
capable of handling a great empire. So, I repeat, I
should have offered you this new power in any case.
Now I ask you to use it as a bait for the Emperor of
Austria. Owing to your alliance it would be a natural
act; unless you could afford to wait for his death, which
you cannot. Tell him that if he refuses you will swallow
him too. But he can hardly hesitate to snatch at the
one compensation for the failures of his reign and life.
Such of the conquered territory as you may have to
yield to him will flow to you naturally at his death,
for his heir could not hold it, and you may be sure that,
as the initiator of so magnificent and beneficent a conquest,
and as the younger and more picturesque of the
majesties, you will be the idol of Austria-Hungary, as
well as the hero of the world. France can be as easily
disposed of as Russia, and indeed every intelligent power
will let you alone after your first battle. Of course you
can have all the money you want should you meet with
opposition in the Reichstag. That offer has always
stood. As for the excuse for war, it will be simple
enough to whip up a disturbance in the Balkans. A
few discreet agents, a revolutionary committee, surreptitious
presents of arms, and Bulgaria or Macedonia is in
flames. A secret understanding with Ferdinand and he
will do anything to get Russia off his back. Then when
the pot is boiling, and the so-called Christians are
sprinkling their gore on their own unspeakable filth,
announce to Christendom that Christian rulers can
stand no more, impose impossible conditions on Russia,
and sail in. There will be enough of these weapons of
destruction ready before the end of three months to
conquer the whole of Europe, and no more time is
necessary to manipulate the Balkans.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>He paused abruptly, and again the two men stared
hard and long at each other. The pallor and the burning
eyes of both testified to the passionate emotion they
controlled. Fessenden had permitted eagerness to
creep neither into his tones nor manner, but he felt as
if he were standing in the dock awaiting a sentence of
life or death. The Emperor felt as if he had been
whirled back to the first years of his reign, when all
things seemed possible to a young and indomitable ruler.
And that reign had been one long and desperate struggle
between his autocratic instincts and the deep and
persistent desire for the extreme rights of man among a
large division of his subjects. He had given them much,
but they wanted more; and being advised by flatterers,
and so far removed from contact with the masses, he
looked upon the greater part of their demands with
angry impatience. But no ruler had ever brought a
more lofty enthusiasm to reform, and he had been
thwarted by ignorance, and conservative stupidity, and
personal hatred, until he sometimes felt that the day
might not be far distant when he should shrug his
shoulders and simmer down into the routine of other
sovereigns. It was true he had accomplished many
things and he had made a great city of Berlin and a
wealthy state of Prussia; but when he thought of his old
ambitions he felt sick with the futility of life. Fessenden’s
abrupt proposition had given him a moment of
unutterable happiness, then almost paralyzed his faculties.
He wondered if he should awake and find himself
alone, still compelled to profess friendship for the
enemy of civilization.</p>

<p>Fessenden continued. “Ranata, of course, will formally
renounce all rights to the throne. But the Emperor’s
consent I will have, if only as a concession
of Europe to the United States—a formal recognition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>
of her absolute equality among nations. I forgot to
tell you that the details of these inventions have been
so worked out that no one but my head electrician and
myself knows them all, and the exact combinations.
And he is not only a man of honor, but no crowned head
in Europe could offer him a bribe comparable to what
he will receive from me on the day of your first battle
with Russia.”</p>

<p>The Emperor came out of his reverie. “Have you
samples here?”</p>

<p>“They are in the custom-house. They have not been
examined, and await your order to pass them through
unopened. The electrician is also here. My father
arrives to-morrow. We can have an object-lesson on
Saturday.”</p>

<p>“Let us have it by all means,” said the Emperor of
Germany.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">XXIX</h3>
</div>

<p>Vienna, the stately brown city, so haughty without, so
simple within. Vienna, the city of beautiful men and
women, of fastidious breeding and dispersing forces.
Vienna, the gay, the wanton, the merciless. Vienna, the
city of the dead soul; the great actress whose still perfect
shell moves mechanically upon the stage, not knowing
under what sudden stroke she may tremble and disappear.
In no city on earth is life so full of charm and yet
of unreality, no city where one feels so alive and yet so
encompassed by dreams, where to the American New
York is not, but a superlative civilization with the taint
of the Middle Ages in its brain.</p>

<p>Ranata felt something of this luscious yet corrupt
flavor of her native city as she drove from the station
to the Hofburg; but vaguely, for her contrasts were few.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>
Moreover, her father had met her, and was talking constantly
and somewhat at random. If Ranata had not
been preoccupied she would have noticed the evident
embarrassment in his manner and his elaborate attempt
at dissimulation. He was more affectionate than was
his wont; a shade less of his perfect breeding and he would
have appeared apologetic. But his daughter’s brain was
heavy and absorbed by one idea. Sarolta was driving to
her own palace, and Ranata was anxious to take advantage
of these few moments with her father. Suddenly
he gave her the opportunity she wished. He remarked
in the tone of one whose masculine recesses have received
a welcome illumination:</p>

<p>“I suppose, my dear, that you have come to Vienna
to have a personal conference with your dressmakers.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Ranata, and it was notable that she did
not smile; “I have come to ask a great favor of your
Majesty, and I beg that you will predispose yourself to
grant it.”</p>

<p>The Emperor stiffened, the natural act of a monarch
whose life is passed with those that crave the royal favor.
But the act to-day was more than mechanical;
there were several portentous favors this extraordinary
daughter of his might have nerved herself to ask—might
indeed have deluded herself she was in a position
to ask—and the very thought of them turned him to
steel.</p>

<p>“Well?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“It is a singular request, sir, for it is for permission
to revive an ancient custom of our house. I wish to go
down into the crypt alone on this midnight and pray by
the coffin of Rudolf.”</p>

<p>The Emperor drew a long breath of relief. There was
nothing remarkable to him in the request, for he believed
his daughter to be as devout a Catholic as himself. “How<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
could a Hapsburg be otherwise?” he would have asked,
if questioned; and dismissed the subject. Nevertheless,
he divined that her mind must be in heavy shadow to
prompt an immediate act of devotion at some inconvenience,
when any other time would have done as well.
Scrutinizing her face, he saw the change in it, even
through the disguise of a veil with heavy dots. Trained
in detail, he remembered that he had never seen her
wear such a veil before. His experienced brain travelled
to the natural solution. There was truth in the
story that she loved the American; and she wished to
do penance among the tombs of her ancestors. That
meant, of course, that the affair was closed, that when
she had realized the enormity of her folly she had hastened
to mortify her flesh and spirit in a worthy manner.
He had not been surprised to hear that she loved at last,
but he wondered at the security into which he had fallen
during the preceding ten years, deluded, like others, by
her superb indifference; and the evident marks of suffering
he saw in her face to-day in nowise set his heart at
odds with his purpose to marry her at once. Even were
he not now convinced that she might at any moment become
a menace to the Dual Monarchy, or had he been
less harassed by those that feared and hated her, he still
would have used his authority to marry her without
delay. He knew the weaknesses of his blood, and was
determined that her very obvious genius to make the
world ring with a scandal should be clogged immediately.
He resolved, however, to defer the subject until the
morrow, snatching at the prospect that the midnight
vigil would subdue and chasten her spirit. He answered
as if he had given her request due consideration:</p>

<p>“There is no objection, if you are sure you have the
strength to go through the ordeal—that you will not
have an attack of hysteria. Of course”—in response to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>
an indignant ejaculation—“I know you are not that sort
of woman, but it will be a trying hour. Sarolta must
accompany you to the church; she can wait for you in
one of the chapels or in the carriage. And a friar will
go down with you to hold the taper. I insist upon that.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Ranata listlessly. The friar would
be an integral part of the scene, like enough to those
who had gone down with her ancestors, dead and alive.</p>

<p>She sat through the early dinner with her father, but
five o’clock was now her hour for tea, and she made a
bare pretence to eat. She wondered if she would be
hungry in the crypt, then scowled so severely at her levity
that Count von Königsegg, who was watching her,
feared that her suspicions had been roused by something
in the dull flow of conversation. Several of the archdukes
were present, besides the many members of the
Emperor’s household, and they were mildly discussing
a crisis in the Reichsrath. The minister had greeted
her coldly. He was profoundly annoyed at the sensation
she had made, and the consequent failure of their
carefully laid plans. That she would play her cards in
Hungary with the historic tact of the Hapsburgs he had
made no doubt, and that she could fascinate and beguile
he had had personal evidence; but that she had in her
the elements of a public popularity, so desirable in a
sovereign, and so reprehensible in anything less than the
acknowledged heir to the throne, he had not for a moment
suspected. These last weeks had left him aghast,
for he was by no means desirous of the slightest disturbance
in the present order of things, nor to be the victim
of suspicion from those who might one day be in a position
to elevate or ruin him. He had been prepared to
declare for the Archduchess if she played her part properly,
and her star shot up at precisely the right moment;
but for the present he was puzzled how to act. His instinct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>
was to desert the sinking ship, but he found it
difficult to connect Ranata with the idea of failure;
she looked, pallid and extinguished as she was, cast for a
great part—not endowed by Nature with the finest gifts
of the Hapsburgs to languish in obscurity. He did not
approve of marrying her. The Emperor’s course must
be nearly run, and she would be a valuable card to
hold when the anticipated calamities fell upon them.
However, the man selected was of Hapsburg blood; no
vow of renunciation would be required of her, and at the
right moment she could be summoned forth. Perhaps
it was as well; for what to do with her meanwhile, he
confessed, was beyond any inspiration likely to visit his
fertile brain. Perhaps she would be ill for a time; she
looked so unlike her usual self as to invite the hope,
and that at least would keep her quiet for some months.</p>

<p>Ranata, suspecting naught of these unsympathetic
reflections, was longing for the night. When she was
finally alone in her rooms—those rooms that looked
like nothing outside the Hofburg except other musty old
palaces where the sun never entered—she sat down in
the dark and attempted to prepare her mind for the
ghostly pilgrimage. Her sense of drama was stirred at
the thought of performing this ancient rite, but she felt
less religious than she had hoped, less ancestral, less
akin to those quaking girls who had been swept down
into the cold vault of the Capuchin by the stern arm of
Maria Theresia. One had died of the small-pox, caught
from the emanations of a recent victim—doubtless the
poor little body had half-disintegrated with fright, and
let the poison in. She wondered if she would be frightened,
and dismissed the thought with an impatient
shrug. Her strong soul had little acquaintance with fear.
Still she would have welcomed a premonition of it at this
moment, if it had brought on its long shadows the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>
mutters of ancestral superstition—the first stirring of
her stupefied Hapsburg sense. But her thought flew
to Fessenden Abbott. She wrenched it from him, and
it fluttered about among the pleasures and distractions
of her months in Hungary. She found herself longing
for the bright rooms in the palace of Buda, the bustling
business-like streets of Pest. She recalled her first and
only visit to a shop, and wished she might repeat the
experience on the morrow; she had had many vivid
accounts of the shops of Vienna from Alexandra, who,
untrammelled by state, or even by the haughty usages of
the aristocracy, visited the shops as often as she pleased.</p>

<p>“I feel hopelessly modern, frivolous,” she thought, as
she rose and walked to the window. “But it is merely
the perversity of the brain. Like a spoiled child, it
must do precisely what is not expected of it. I thought
I had disciplined it better.”</p>

<p>She held aside a corner of the lace curtain, and peered
down into the court-yard, and at the battered walls opposite.
There would have been no danger of detection
had her room been light, for the rain was falling heavily.
The court-yard was deserted; and the scene was intolerably
dreary. A prison-yard could be no worse.</p>

<p>Suddenly she was seized with a wild unreasoning terror,
an impulse to fly from the Hofburg to Budapest and
her many friends. A premonition seemed to rise out of
the dark and press close upon her. Her brain tossed
up the reserve, the embarrassment of her father’s manner,
the watchful speculative regard of Königsegg’s cold
eyes, the sensation of insignificance that had vaguely assailed
her as she arrived in Vienna—of stepping down
from a pedestal to withdraw into a niche. Why had she
left Hungary? There she would have been safe, for
nothing short of violence could have removed her, and
that they would not dare to use. She touched the electric<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>
button as soon as she could find it; and when the room
was softly brilliant, she wondered at her nerves. Determined
to reduce them to subjection before their midnight
ordeal, she sat down with a novel Alexandra had
given her at parting. This was not the preparation for
nocturnal prayer she might have wished, but it could be
no more mischievous than her own unruly thoughts.
It proved to be absorbing—a brisk well-written tale of
mediæval love and adventure, war and romantic incident,
without psychology, or a reminder of modern life
and character. It was not the literature of her habit,
but for that reason perhaps held her the more closely,
the tenor of her mind being altered, and life as she knew
it best forgotten. When, at a quarter to twelve, one of
her maids entered with a long fur garment, and the announcement
that the Obersthofmeisterin awaited the
pleasure of her Imperial Highness, she arose with reluctance,
and, as the woman adjusted the cloak and hood,
glanced at the finish. “If I had not been sure of that
final rapture,” she informed herself apologetically, “I
believe I could not have rid my mind of it in the church.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">XXX</h3>
</div>

<p>Sarolta had sunk on a hot-water cushion in one of the
chapels of the Capuchin Church, after an involuntary
appeal to her archduchess to pray no longer than she
could help. The friar, a dark blur in his brown robes,
unlocked the door that opens on the winding stair sacred
to the House of Hapsburg. As Ranata carried a lighted
taper in her own hand, she motioned to him to walk
behind her, and picked her way on the uneven stones
worn by four centuries of men and women who had gone
down with the dead, or to pray among the ruins of those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>
who had ruled and loved and oppressed, or battled in
secret and impotence with the wretched comedy of their
existence. Twice before—since her early girlhood, when
her tutor in history had included an occasional visit to
the Hapsburg dust in his course—had Ranata descended
this stair: behind the coffin of Rudolf, and the coffin
of her mother. The first time she had been blind and
dumb with grief; the second, horror-stricken as she still
was, she had meditated sadly upon the conquest of life
over the charming and singular woman she had known
so little. To-night, as she reached the foot of the stair,
and held the taper aloft, she was conscious of little but
the cold and the dank smell of death, which in spite of
glass and lead and bronze, and robbed of its final offensiveness,
pervades the crypt. It is an odor hardly
definable; it might be the very breath of Death himself
rising thickly through earth and mould.</p>

<p>Ranata shuddered and drew her cloak about her, but
walked resolutely down between the long rows of sarcophagi,
elaborate and ostentatiously simple, crowding
close behind the bars. She was thankful that her father
had insisted upon the escort of the friar; but when she
came to the great gates behind which Maria Theresia
still reigns in the pomp of death over those that have
followed her, and her silent attendant had turned the
key, she motioned to him to remain without.</p>

<p>She stood for a moment looking with a curious impersonality,
of which she could not divest herself, at the
magnificent leaden sarcophagus, on its pedestal, of one
of the few great rulers of Austria. The carving and
chasing, the bas-reliefs and fixtures, were so elaborate
and beautiful that she caught herself wondering how
many years the august remains had awaited their final
state, or if the far-sighted Empress had set the craftsmen
to work long before her death. She was a practical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>
soul, and it was likely. At her feet, in the plainest
of leaden coffins, lay the husband she had loved and
snubbed. About her, in receptacles of varying art and
costliness, were nine of her sixteen children.</p>

<p>Ranata turned her back upon the last vanity of the
ancestor who had been a religion of her youth, and passing
the equally lofty but far less imposing sarcophagus
of Franz II., with the perfunctory receptacles of his four
wives scattered near, she paused for a moment beside
the long coffins of Napoleon’s second wife, and of him
who had been called King of Rome and Duke of Reichstadt—he
whom the French remembered as the second
Napoleon when his cousin seized the throne. She stared
down at the lead above the dust of the little cousin for
whom she had much sympathy and compassion, knowing
him to have been the victim of court intrigues, his
soul and body systematically ruined. She wondered
how much rebellion had beaten beneath that apparent
docility, how much cunning, perhaps; biding his time
in his grandfather’s old age, hating and fearing Metternich,
yet neither wise enough nor strong enough to avoid
the traps that never cut his feet, and closed about him
as softly and warmly as sirens and drugs. She wondered
if the French poet had divined the secretive nature
correctly, or if a true Hapsburg brain had dissolved
in the silences of the crypt; then, if the ruined soul had
been graciously relit in consideration of its youth and
ignorance; if, in some juster world, the fine brain he may
have inherited might not now in its maturity be fulfilling
the purpose for which it had sprung from a force that
would still seem to haunt the earth.</p>

<p>These were not the thoughts, the sulking superstitions,
she had come to evoke, and she passed on. The alcove
containing what was left of her mother and brother,
with the angel between them presented by the ladies of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>
Hungary, was before her, but she wished before kneeling
and praying there to saturate herself with this subtle
atmosphere of ancient death, of indestructible repose,
of serene and final disassociation from the world above.
This portion of the crypt is only two-thirds below
ground. A high small window admits a patch of light
by day; but the glass is heavy, and no sound penetrates.
The Hapsburgs sleep as quietly as the Pharaohs.</p>

<p>Ranata wandered past the brilliant silver-like coffin of
Ferdinand Maximilian Joseph, but she did not linger;
she had little sympathy with the unknown uncle whose
wavering brain had cost him throne and life. “If I had
had Mexico,” she thought arrogantly, “I should have
kept it. Picturesque an object as he was with his American
empire, and his brave death, he will never be a favorite
in history or romance, for human nature despises
the waverer. What the Americans call bluff is not only
the wiser policy, but makes a stronger appeal to the imagination.”
She walked down between the long rows
of the lesser dead, pausing a moment at the simple coffin
of that cousin who had set her thin frock on fire with
a lighted cigarette, hastily concealed as her father approached.
She smiled with tender pity, grateful that
her own parent, obdurate in many things, was advanced
in a few simple particulars.</p>

<p>Finally she returned to the elevated remains of the old
Emperor Franz, and holding her taper high, looked slowly
about her. It was a sufficiently grewsome sight, those
piles and rows of gray sarcophagi, most of them but stark
shadows under the meagre light she carried, and the ray
of a lamp that filtered through the little window. She
gave an involuntary shudder of feminine horror, and
once more experienced a throb of gratitude for the proximity
of the friar, standing beyond the door. He had
extinguished his taper and looked like a statue at prayer.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>
Her eye rested again on the coffin of the Duc de
Reichstadt. “Poor Franz!” she thought. “What barbarians
they were only two-thirds of a century ago! I
wonder how much better we are now—they! I feel,
rather, as if my spirit had been purged down here, than
packed with its old ghosts.”</p>

<p>She let her taper trail on the stones. Her pilgrimage
was a failure. The night and its horrid suggestions had
accomplished no degeneration for her; she might as well
have come by day, or spared at any time her limbs the
cold, her nostrils this infliction. And there she faced and
accepted the truth. What she had been was gone, what
she was so must she remain. Her brain in its absolute
modernity must help her to endure and to regulate her
life; from her ancestors she would receive no further
help, neither now nor ever. From all miasmatic obsessions
rising out of the crypt in her soul she was free
henceforth; the crypt itself had vanished into that eternity
so far from the corruption about her. She lifted
her head suddenly with a sensation of liberty, of independence,
which even Hungary and her intimate spiritual
absorption of her American lover had not given her.
Then she went forward and knelt at the foot of Rudolf’s
coffin. She had rejected dogmas and theologies, but
she still could pray; for she had perfect faith in an overruling
power, who, if great enough to manage the universe,
must be great enough to answer prayer without
upsetting the balance of His machinery. And prostrate
at the foot of the ugly bronze coffin under half its height
of brittle wreaths, that held the clay of the warmest
nature she had ever known, of the only being she had
deeply loved until now, of the Hapsburg whose light
might have raised him so high in history and had gone
out in folly and dishonor, she had her moment of profound
tribute to the dead, of utter abnegation of self.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>
When she rose from her knees she entered the recess,
and pushing aside the old wreaths with their emblazoned
streamers, the gifts of kings, and princes, of family, and
illustrious subjects, she pressed her wet face for a moment
to the head of the coffin, then walked rapidly from
the inner crypt, down the lane between the older dead,
and up the stair.</p>

<p>Sarolta was not in her chapel, and, dismissing the friar,
Ranata left the church. The Obersthofmeisterin was
in a corner of the carriage sound asleep. The coachman
slept profoundly on the box. The footman had disappeared.
Ranata stood alone in the streets of Vienna.
The clock struck one. She, a daughter of the Hapsburgs,
was as free as any waif in the city. The sensation of liberty
which had taken possession of her down in the
crypt surged wildly to her head. She walked swiftly
to the corner and stood there, pushing back her hood
and staring about her. The rain had ceased, but the
night was black. What was there to prevent her from
finding a cab, driving to the station, and taking the first
train for Berlin? If Fessenden were not already there
a telegram would summon him in haste. From Berlin
it was but a few hours to Bremen. She took another
step forward, then almost laughed aloud. Was this
the first result of her rendezvous with the dead? But
if that had been futile, her brain and her sense of duty
were still in control. She had renounced love once for
all. Moreover, her flight would mean the exile and disgrace
in her old age of Sarolta. To-morrow she would
return to Hungary and take up her work there. Now
that she knew exactly on what forces she must rely, she
could hope to walk her self-appointed path without faltering;
and in gratitude for her strength, and for a memory
which the inflexible laws of her station could never
take from her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>Nevertheless, she lingered for a time, walking aimlessly
to and fro, for it was the most complete liberty she
had ever known, and she enjoyed it much as a child enjoys
itself the first time it runs away. It also appealed
to her sense of humor, and she would have been amused
still more could she have come face to face with her
father.</p>

<p>And so she rejected her second opportunity for flight
and actual liberty, awakened the terrified coachman, and
returned to the Hofburg.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">XXXI</h3>
</div>

<p>She slept well, and late; then being already long past
her early hour of rising, lay for a time, half in pleasure
of that narrow world wherein she still could confuse
dreams and life, half in dread of the realities into which
she must step with her clothes. Should she go to Budapest
that day? It occurred to her too late that it is
more difficult to return to the associations identified
with the intense or tragic moments of life even than to
remain among them. Should she stay in Vienna for a
few days? The Hofburg had never seemed so dreary;
her own rooms were musty and chill. In Buda, at
least, she would be companioned, and she should find
novel work to do immediately upon her return. She
remembered Fessenden’s early suggestion to conciliate
the Independents by inviting their wives to the palace.
Many of these men were her slaves, but of them several
would not come to Buda, and others held wholly aloof.
She should persuade to her cause, as soon as she returned,
the patriotism of the influential women of the aristocracy.
And there were charities to organize, subtler methods
of conquest to be conceived, now that society had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>
been won by gayeties and pleasure. As soon as the winter
broke she would make her progress through the
country; she had made the impression she desired on the
crowds that had met her at the stations in Transylvania.
It was all easy enough, this brilliant preliminary, but
what of the future? Would she have her great public
career, and would it console her for the renunciation of
what she wanted at that moment more than the career
of a Maria Theresia or even the triumph of cold duty?
As she awoke fully the tenderness and passion, roused
and stimulated, yet so little satisfied in these past weeks,
which for two days and nights had been quiescent under
the sullen despair of her brain, now, after long hours of
refreshing sleep, rushed in tumult through all her channels
of emotion; and all her soul and body shook with
longing and regret. Why should she not see him once
more? And would it always be once more, and once
more? Would her life be bearable if his expulsion from
it were final? She had not seen so far into the future
while with him, but now it looked as empty and cold as
space. <i>Could this be the end?</i> She almost cried the
words aloud as she sprang from her bed in a frantic desire
to take some step—at once—before it was too late.
He could not have sailed, for he had told her he should
spend some days in Berlin, and his yacht was at Trieste.
She should see him again if the world stood still. In all
the emotions that had rent her, even after the terrible
deaths of her brother and mother, she had never so faced
the awful vista of finality; and she discovered that it was
the one for which she had no power in her to endure.
Of course he must leave her at last, but not yet! It is
all very well for the old and the wise to argue with the
accents of fatigue that love is not the only thing in life;
so it is not, for those that argue.</p>

<p>She rang. Her women came in and dressed her in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>
travelling costume. She sent a note to the Princess
Sarolta, asking her to be ready an hour hence, and another
to her father expressing a wish to bid him <i>Aufwiedersehen</i>.
The Emperor replied that he would call
upon her as soon as she had finished her coffee, and that
it was with regret he was obliged to inform her that her
Obersthofmeisterin had caught a severe cold the night
before and was unable to leave her bed. He had sent a
messenger to Maria Leopoldina, who was at Baden, asking
her to resume for the moment her old duties; and
doubtless she would arrive in the course of the day.</p>

<p>It was a long message, and the Emperor had taken
the trouble to write it, when a simple announcement by
a chamberlain that he would call upon her immediately
would have sufficed. Ranata left her breakfast-room
abruptly, and stood alone in her dressing-room removing
her hat with shaking fingers. For what was he preparing
her? What pathway smoothing for himself? Had
Piroska tattled? Was she to receive the paternal fiat
that she must never see Fessenden Abbott again? Her
father might require her submission before permitting
her to return to Hungary. Had the world come to an
end? She felt as if the floor were swaying and sinking.</p>

<p>She heard the Emperor’s voice in the salon, and controlled
herself and went in to meet him. Her eyes met
his squarely in the manner he detested. He kissed her,
however, and congratulated her upon her improved appearance.
She had rarely looked better than in this
frock of green cloth and steel and sable, so simple and
closely fitting that on her slim yet heroic figure it gave
her a somewhat warlike appearance. The Emperor
himself was looking remarkably well, in his parade uniform
with its sky-blue coat and black and scarlet trousers.
He had been in the saddle for two hours inspecting
his troops, and the fresh color was in his cheeks, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span>
well-exercised body was almost as free and elastic as his
daughter’s. He sat erect and alert like the good soldier
he was; but with the wariness of the diplomat he had
taken the precaution to seek this interview on the enemy’s
territory that he might retreat if a sudden lapse
in the negotiations seemed wise; he knew that he would
be physically unable to expel Ranata from his apartments
until she chose to go.</p>

<p>He began with diplomacy, also, asking her of the pilgrimage
of the night before; complimented her on her
courage and piety—and no man could turn a compliment
more neatly. But as Ranata answered him in monosyllables
and preserved an upright attitude of expectancy,
he felt himself driven towards the point.</p>

<p>“My dear,” he began delicately, “it has come to my
knowledge that you are more interested than is prudent
in the brother of your friend.” He paused, but as Ranata
made no reply, nor even changed color, he continued.
“Of course it is to be expected that a girl as
beautiful as you are will captivate many men, aloof as
you must hold yourself; but I am surprised that you
have permitted a devotion so conspicuous as to create
gossip. A princess can never be sure that gossip will
stop short of scandal; for where a woman may not select
her own husband, the idle and the envious are always on
the lookout for an irregular connection to gloat over.
I am very sorry to seem to reprove you—”</p>

<p>“I have expected it, of course. I knew that the little
Zápolya was a spy; and she also wished to marry Mr.
Abbott.”</p>

<p>“I hope you will give me the credit of having lived
long enough to sift evidence before I decide, of making
due allowance for circumstances, and of accepting no
evidence unsupported. You and Mr. Abbott have been
much in public together; your mutual interest has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>
commented upon far and wide. I have been warned from
more sources than one. If I had known that Count
Zrinyi had invited Mr. Abbott—and scarcely any one
else!—to accompany you to Transylvania, I should have
forbidden the visit. It had long been a part of your
programme, and I inferred, as a matter of course, that
you would be accompanied by a full court and a large
number of guests. There is no doubt in my mind that
Zrinyi made this opportunity for you, and he must take
the consequences—”</p>

<p>“I doubt if he gave my private affairs a thought. He
may have cared to entertain me as a princess, but his
first object was to see as much of Alexandra alone as
possible—in romantic surroundings.”</p>

<p>“That may be. Now I must ask you if you are prepared
to deny that you took a walk at midnight up there
alone with Mr. Abbott; that you managed upon numberless
occasions to see him alone—at Buda, as well as
at Zrinyi-vár? That he wore Prince Nadasdy’s costume
on the night of the fancy-dress ball, and that you both
retired simultaneously—”</p>

<p>“I deny nothing,” said Ranata. “I am in no humor
to make a sentimental confession. Your Majesty may
believe or not that I love him. I have, however, sent
him away. That should satisfy you. You will accept
my word, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Your word is the last I should doubt. But I happen
to know that human nature is stronger than promises.
You will not send for him, but he will return. He
is a young man with an exceptional record for attaining
his ends. If he manages to see you alone again after a
separation”—he spread out his little hands with the
grace of his Spanish ancestors—“I should not answer for
the consequences. If you were your mother I should
have no apprehension, for she was devoid of passion;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span>
but you are a Hapsburg, and God knows I have had
knowledge enough of the weakness of my race to act
promptly when I am graciously vouchsafed a timely
warning.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do about it?” asked Ranata—unconsciously,
in her quick suspicion, using the American
vernacular, although her language was German; her
father had never found it necessary to learn English.</p>

<p>This time the Emperor met her eye fully, although his
heart quaked. “I have determined that it is time for
you to marry,” he said in a louder tone than he was
sensible of in time.</p>

<p>Ranata laughed. She was surprised at her rudeness.
The disrespectful ebullition was due partly to nervousness;
but the Emperor’s brave announcement had also
struck at the quick of her humor.</p>

<p>His Majesty’s ruddy face deepened in hue, but he had
too difficult a task to accomplish to permit himself the
luxury of a personal sensation. He had steeled his heart
against pity; to give himself up to anger was unworthy,
and he brushed the emotion aside. He would have been
glad to see his daughter happy, but the stoicism of lonely
majesty had been immutably set in his case by the
many and agonizing personal experiences which he had
weathered into a healthy and tolerable old age. Princes
were born to earthly martyrdom tempered by much casual
consolation. If their women were forced to play
their part without the compensations, that was the decree
of God, who made kings, and they must suffer and
make no complaint. As a rule they did, and it was the
manifest duty of him who was divinely permitted to
govern to see that they found no opportunity to do
otherwise. “You are overwrought, I fear,” he said
tactfully. “Did you sleep well after your pilgrimage?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>“Perfectly. May I ask whom your Majesty has considered
as a son-in-law?”</p>

<p>The Emperor made a slight motion that in a person
of less graceful dignity might have been mistaken for a
squirm. He had no doubt of the wisdom of his choice—his
own choice he believed it to be—for his relative,
if stern and unbending, a disciplinarian of the first rank,
was neither brutal nor cruel, nor, if met with a discreet
submission, unamiable. The idea of handing over his
potential daughter to this Gibraltar among husbands,
who had responded with enthusiasm to the invitation
to marry a beautiful and wealthy princess, had taken
full possession of the apprehensive mind of the old monarch;
but he had not planned to break the name until
after the right amount of preparation. He had anticipated
that Ranata would dissolve into tears and perhaps
more tempestuous emotions, under cover of which
he could retreat, to communicate in writing the fulness
of her fate. But there was no sign of a tear in the large
angry eyes transfixing him, and her full fine mouth, with
its short upper lip and unsatisfied corners, looked as if
a sob had never shaken it.</p>

<p>“Well?” she asked.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but to plump out the name.
Even were he willing to gain time by asserting that the
man had not yet been chosen, he knew that she would
detect the lie and place him at an immediate disadvantage.
He answered stolidly,</p>

<p>“Aloys Franz—”</p>

<p>“What?” she stood up and stared down upon him as
if she were repeating his statement to herself and endeavoring
to place it in connection with her brain. In
a moment the blood rose hotly to her hair, even her
eyes looked bloodshot. “Oh!” she exclaimed. “Oh!”
and then she walked to the window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>It was an opportune moment for retreat, but there
was more to be said; she was calm, and the sooner the
whole task was finished the better.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you will understand why I think it best
you should not return to Budapest,” he said gently. “It
is well for many reasons that this wedding take place
at once, and it is my duty to expose you to no further
temptation. It can be given out that your trousseau
detains you here, or Sarolta’s illness—”</p>

<p>Ranata wheeled about and faced him. For the first
time in her life she was ugly.</p>

<p>“And have you really deluded yourself,” she asked
with an ominous calm, “that you will marry me to that
man?—or to any one else?”</p>

<p>The Emperor rose then and faced her. War was declared,
and he knew where he stood. There was no better
mettle in Europe than his.</p>

<p>“You will marry Aloys Franz,” he said.</p>

<p>Again Ranata laughed, and for the moment she
looked hideous. “I shall not,” she said. “And you
should know by this time what stuff I am made of.”</p>

<p>“I have not had a doubt of your resistance. I have
as little of my firmness of purpose. You have not been
sufficiently disciplined. A princess marries whom and
when her father and sovereign dictates. You were my
youngest, in many ways exceptional, and very much
alone. I have been more indulgent, more lax, than I
should. But that is over. From this moment you will
recognize that I am your emperor as well as your father.”</p>

<p>“We are no longer in the Middle Ages, nor yet in the
middle of the last century. Your subjects are free to
marry whom they please, or to remain unmarried if they
choose.”</p>

<p>“Constitutions have shorn monarchs of too much
power over their subjects, but in his own family the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span>
power of an emperor is as absolute as it ever was. To
the law you would have no appeal did I choose to practise
upon you the tortures of the Inquisition here in my
palace, to starve you in a cell, to cause you to disappear
forever from human sight. Please understand once for
all that you are my property, given into my care by Almighty
God; and for your own salvation and for the honor
of my house I shall do what I think best with you.”</p>

<p>“And if I still refuse?”</p>

<p>“You will remain a prisoner in these rooms until you
consent. Your servants will attend to every want, you
will have the society of Maria Leopoldina, and you may
take your exercise in the corridor. You will see no one
else. There will be a guard day and night at each end
of the corridor. If you make any attempt to bribe
these guards, or to communicate with any one in the
court-yard, you will be moved elsewhere and deprived
of exercise. But I do not wish to be forced into undue
severity, and you may remain here so long as you transgress
no rules.”</p>

<p>“Good God!” she exclaimed. “And this is the twentieth
century! Have I heard aright? Am I a prisoner
under an armed guard? Am I more helpless in the
eyes of the law than the meanest of your subjects? May
any illiterate peasant woman seek redress in the courts
of justice while a princess of the realm, whose supreme
advantages have set her apart from mankind, is but a
chattel among the possessions of her father? I suppose
I have known this. But I have managed to surround
myself with a different atmosphere. But you—you
are a man of the world, and all your faculties are still
alert—do you mean to tell me that you have not outgrown
the barbarism of the past?”</p>

<p>“You may call it by what name you will. I shall go
now, and you will meditate—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>But Ranata had flashed between him and the door,
and he knew that he could not pass her. He was deeply
annoyed that he had not retreated in time, but he stood
immobile, looking coldly into her distorted face.</p>

<p>“No,” she said hoarsely, but still retaining an appreciable
measure of self-control; “you will not leave this
room until you have heard the truth for once. If you
are no longer my father but my tyrant, then from this
moment I am your most rebellious subject and nothing
more. And I would that I could open my veins and
drain out every drop of royal blood. Has it ever occurred
to you, sir, that the great enlightened masses
not only in America but here in central Europe regard
us not with the hatred of half a century ago, but with
impatience and contempt; that they look upon us as
anomalies, anachronisms, ornamental nuisances, and do
not rise to let out our blood on the guillotine only because
they are well aware of the peaceful disintegration, the
irresistible rising of the tide of independence and liberty?
If your people love you—here, not in Hungary!—it is
for your personal qualities, not because you represent
an idea which, in their estimate of life and civilization,
they have relegated to the past, with crinolines and
Bath chairs. Do you suppose that what loyalty you
enjoy will be transferred to the Heir? You know it will
not. That alone is proof enough that the people are carelessly—perhaps
unconsciously—determined to have what
they want—monarchy, only if it happen to suit them at
the moment. There is only one monarchy on the face
of the earth enlightened enough to grasp this fact before
it is too late, and that is England. There alone is monarchy
not ridiculous—and not threatened. What do
you suppose is the meaning of the immense and undaunted
increase of socialism in Germany? What is the
meaning of the incalculable and persistent forces of disintegration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span>
in this empire? Look at Italy. At Spain.
At Turkey. At Russia—that dares not sleep. Only
the insignificant little monarchies are comparatively safe
from themselves, being occupied with apprehension of
the greater. Even in the United States the unsatisfied
tide of liberty is rising. McKinley was not shot by
a lunatic, a fanatic, nor by a member of any deadly organization;
the assassin was merely one of the millions
of dissatisfied poor in the richest country on earth,
where he saw liberty and justice becoming as paralytic
as in Europe. Did the portent of that assassination
never occur to you? And with this spirit abroad in the
world we dare over here to play at divine rights, at
being hereditary rulers of millions more enlightened
than ourselves—we—pygmies—marionettes—who may
be born as foolish as the last Emperor of Austria and
King of Hungary, who thought that all eagles had two
heads, and yet dare to mount a throne and cry ‘I am
King!’ No one has ever more devoutly tried to do
what he conceived to be his inherited duty than I have
done. I have, for many years, been deliberately blind.
During these last months in Hungary I have <i>held</i> the
scales to my eyes lest they fall off. Last night down
there in the crypt, where, if you must know, I went in
the hope of finding my old idols, I lost most of those scales.
To-day I have lost the last of them. If I had it in my
power to do, I would give liberty and the broadest
sort of constitutional government to every man that
breathes. I am mortified that it took the deprivation
of my own liberty to force my brain to acknowledge the
truth. I would rather I had been less human and welcomed
the truth as the result of much deep and intelligent
meditation. But to expect the godlike of one of
us of royal blood is beyond reason, and I am thankful
that I am not too dense to receive illumination from any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span>
source. But I loathe my blood. I hope to God I may
live to see every monarch now alive a useful member of
a republic and no man degraded by being forced to
submit to what he had no hand in making. I am sorry
to have detained and agitated you; and for any unintentional
rudeness I hope your Majesty will forgive me.
For you, until to-day, I have had a great respect. For
what you stand for it is impossible that I should ever
again have anything but the profoundest contempt. I
will not detain you any longer except to repeat that
you will save yourself a great deal of trouble if you give
up at once this idea of marrying me to any man but the
one I shall select for myself.”</p>

<p>She no longer looked hideous. The relief of her emotions,
the tide of passion which had surged over its dam
laden with the profoundest truth of the century, had
carried her to the heights of her nature, and she had
never been more beautiful—nor more formidable. Not
so the Emperor. He was purple, and his heavy underlip
trembled. But he preserved his dignity, his soldierly
bearing. As she moved aside to let him pass, he
bowed courteously to her without speaking and left
the room.</p>

<p>The Princess Sarolta, Prince Illehazy, Countess Vilma
Festetics, Alexandra Abbott, and Count Zrinyi sat in
agitated conclave in the palace of Buda. The Countess
Piroska Zápolya was officially in bed with an attack of
influenza.</p>

<p>The five friends sat close together in the blue drawing-room.
Sarolta had related the story of the appalling interview
between the Emperor and Ranata as reported
to herself by a faithful maid of the Archduchess; who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span>
had almost fainted in a window-curtain. The woman
had escaped to invoke the aid of the powerful Obersthofmeisterin
before orders had been issued for the isolation
of the Archduchess’s servants.</p>

<p>“There you are!” exclaimed Sarolta, who frequently
expressed herself in English for the sake of its facile
idiom. “God help us, what a lashing she must have
given him! It was not the first, poor dear man, but I
doubt if he ever had it quite so straight; for Ranata’s
brain would always preserve her from the usual feminine
tangents. But—but—our poor princess! she is a
prisoner! Do you realize it? He will keep his word,
the more rigorously as he now no doubt thinks she is
mad. And <i>Aloys Franz</i>! If I didn’t love Ranata, nothing
would amuse me more than to look on at his attempts
to reduce her to submission. But the situation
is not humorous; it is tragic! What in Heaven’s name
are we to do to help her? We shall not be able even to
get a word of consolation to her; not one of us will be
allowed to visit her; she will receive no letters; she will
be shut up for months, perhaps, with <i>Maria Leopoldina</i>,
for whom I feel an even more acute sympathy than
for herself. And she, with that active brain, that nervous
temperament—no exercise, no society, no change—Good
God! she may lose her reason.”</p>

<p>“That need not concern us,” said Alexandra. “Nor
Aloys Franz. They’ll never marry her, with or without
antediluvian methods. But the rest is bad enough.
Surely the Emperor will let her exercise in the riding-school.
She would still be in the Hofburg and sufficiently guarded.”</p>

<p>“I am sure the Emperor will not hear of it. The
official announcement has been made that she is suffering
from a light attack of influenza—light, you will
understand, that neither suspicion nor too much sympathy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>
may be awakened. If she went as far as the
riding-school there would be too many people in the
secret. She is confined to five rooms and a corridor,
and there I am afraid she will stay. Refractory princesses
have been shut up since the beginning of kings,
and will be until all the kings have gone to the guillotine.
Poor dear!”</p>

<p>“I shall telegraph to my brother at once. We have a
code. He will get her out. Be sure of that. If he
doesn’t he may look upon his life as a failure. He will,
however.”</p>

<p>“Would it not be better,” suggested Prince Illehazy,
“if Mr. Abbott did not take any step in the matter? It
might create a scandal and do the Princess a lasting
injury. She has a severe ordeal before her, but I think
there is no doubt she will win. Her will is stronger than
the King’s. I think it would be better to leave the
matter to Time.”</p>

<p>“Time!—a woman like Ranata for six months, a year,
in confinement and uncertainty! She must be got out
at once, and there is only one person who can make the
deliverance final. Now I am going to say something
that will make you all jump. My brother intends to
marry Ranata.”</p>

<p>They did jump, with the exception of Vilma.</p>

<p>“<i>Ach so!</i>” Sarolta’s tones were guttural with irony,
but her fingers shook slightly as she lit a cigar.</p>

<p>“But, mademoiselle,” murmured Prince Illehazy
politely, “you know, of course, that it is impossible.
No one can sympathize more than I with the romance of
youth, and I have been deeply interested; but marriage—between
an Archduchess of Austria and Princess of
Hungary and, pardon me, an American—you who know
your Europe must surely have discouraged Mr. Abbott.”</p>

<p>“I never set myself impossible tasks. Fessenden will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span>
marry Ranata; of that I have not the slightest doubt. I
know now that I have always anticipated it—and so has
my father!—although as far as I am concerned I thought
of it until lately as a dream, rather. I know now that it
was a belief, and founded on my intimate knowledge of
both and of their fitness for each other; as well as on
that very knowledge of Europe which assures me that
if I live I shall see greater social revolutions than the
marriage of an American with a princess of the blood.
You are dumfounded because you know Europe only.
Go over and live in the United States for a while and
you will come back with the future in your brain as
well as the past.”</p>

<p>“I have never been in the United States, but I think
this strange love-affair is the most beautiful thing in
the world, and I would help them if I could!”</p>

<p>It was Vilma who spoke, and she was leaning forward
with her hands gripping the arms of her chair. The
grayish pallor of her skin had never been more noticeable,
and the lines about her mouth were tense. Not only
had every nerve been on edge since Ranata’s departure
two days ago, but she was possessed by the exaltation
of the martyr; she was not going to the stake for the
ideals of the proud aristocracy of her ancient country,
but in sacrificing those ideals in the hope to compass the
happiness of two exceptional beings she felt that she
had made good her claim to the martyr’s crown. But
the time had come when her morbidity might prove more
useful than the healthy impatience of Alexandra, who
had little talent for intrigue; and who looked upon
Vilma as one of the unfortunate products of a too
conservative aristocracy.</p>

<p>“Princess,” she continued, appealing to her chief,
“you do not approve, of course. But you would not
betray us if we attempted to help her?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span>Sarolta bit the end of her cigar. “I would do all I
could to help her out of this difficulty; but connive at
her marriage with an American—never! I have outgrown
romantic nonsense; and I am also a loyal subject
of my king, although I do think he is an—”</p>

<p>“But what you did not know, dear Princess, you
would not feel obliged to discover, now that you are
no longer Obersthofmeisterin,” said Vilma wheedlingly.
“Why not leave it to her? You do not believe, do you,
that she would make such a marriage?”</p>

<p>“I do not. There at least my faith is unshaken.”</p>

<p>“Then take me to Vienna with you, and close your
eyes if I try to communicate with her. Only I can, for I
am quite unknown in Vienna, insignificant in appearance,
and if the King has ever seen me he would not recognize
me. I cannot go unless you take me, but go I must.”</p>

<p>Sarolta, whose heart, as the astute Vilma well knew,
was aching, appeared to consider deeply. Finally she
shrugged her shoulders. “I cannot see what you could
accomplish; but you might let her see you occasionally in
the Franzensplatz and give her a little comfort. The rest
of us cannot go near it. Alex, of course you will return
with me as soon as I have closed the palace. Zrinyi, I
think you and Vienna had better be strangers for the
present.”</p>

<p>“I go to Vienna the day you do,” announced Zrinyi.
“The King, on second thoughts, will do nothing more to
irritate Hungary. If he ordered me out of Vienna I
should return here and tell the whole story. Molnár
would go off his head and demand the liberty and return
of the Princess as the price of peace in the country.
In any case he could set the tongues of all Europe
wagging, and the King would find himself outwitted.
He is shrewd enough to know this—or his ministers
are. They will pursue a very moderate and conservative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span>
course outside the Hofburg. After all, this is the
twentieth century.”</p>

<p>“Who would have thought it!” said Alexandra. “Will
you come with me, Count, while I write my telegram,
and then send it yourself?”</p>

<p>“I would take it to Berlin if I could get there as
quickly,” said Zrinyi gallantly.</p>

<p>“Count,” murmured his tormentor as they left the
room, “you are a brick. I am a grateful soul. I feel
uncommonly like rewarding you.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">XXXIII</h3>
</div>

<p>For twenty-four hours Ranata’s brain whirled to no
machinery but her wrath. To that succeeded an energetic
desire to escape. All her prejudices and separate
ambitions had gone down in that final moment
of disillusion, and she was determined to marry Fessenden
Abbott as soon as she was beyond the reach of her
father. But her brain, fertile as it was, and abnormally
active, could conceive no method of leaving unobserved
that great palace of many corridors never for a moment
deserted. She was forced to relinquish her intention
to bribe the guards, for there were constantly
three together, and it would seem that they were changed
every half-hour. To assume the disguise of a servant
was equally impracticable, for not one of those in attendance
upon her reached her shoulder, and they were
as closely watched as herself. Her rooms were not
high above the ground, but a guard paced beneath her
window day and night, and the guard-room was opposite.
She was in the very heart of a great European capital
preeminent in science and art, the civilized virtues and
vices, not a hundred yards from cabs and crowded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span>
streets, and no mountain fortress could enclose her
more securely.</p>

<p>When Maria Leopoldina arrived, after a delay welcome
to both, Ranata greeted her with some warmth,
but frankly asked her to remain in her own rooms as
much as possible. This the duenna was more than
willing to do. Not only had she returned to her exacting
post from her pleasant retirement with a reluctance
she dared not express to her sovereign, but she had a
very considerable understanding of her former charge,
and was by no means unsympathetic. She recognized
the necessity of drastic measures in so lamentable a
state of a princess’s affections and temper, and she
should do her duty cost her what it might; but she
would obey the letter of her instructions only, and
leave the prisoner such freedom as she still could find
within her own walls.</p>

<p>And then the days dragged themselves out. Ranata
saw no one but her cousin and servants, received no
message from the world; even Maria Leopoldina was
not permitted the solace of a newspaper. Ranata seldom
sat down, but moved about until all her body ached
with weariness, pausing every few moments to look down
upon the Franzensplatz, through the sheltering lace of
the curtain, in the hope that Fessenden Abbott would
saunter through with intent to give her courage. If
she tried to forget her plight in a book she would fling
it down presently and fly to the window lest she miss
him.</p>

<p>In these first hours she was too hard for lovers’ regrets,
so wroth was she at the insult put upon her individuality,
and so great her astonishment that with all the intellect
and character of which she had vaunted herself she was
as helpless to move in behalf of her own destiny, as poor
in resource, in these primitive circumstances to which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span>
her father and sovereign had reduced her, as any little
fool of the Middle Ages. Although she had been warned
by her opportunities of close observation against the
devouring and repulsive selfishness of those who pushed
the <i>culte du moi</i> to its modern limits, yet few women had
so proudly developed their individuality, few had so
jealously insisted upon the right of the brain to its own
thoughts, of the character to develop in its own way
and as far as human limitations would permit. If she
had until her visit to Hungary been submissive to the
laws of her position it had been because she had deliberately
chosen submission, and aloofness, as her part,
as her highest duties to her house; not because she
stood in the slightest awe of her father, or recognized
his right to direct her thoughts and conduct. It is
doubtful if she could have loved Fessenden Abbott had
she not recognized in him a spirit as free as her own,
and an enlightenment and a sympathetic understanding
which would never seek to change nor control her. She
had found a mate, not a master, and both being the
extreme products of their century, their prospects of a
lifelong desire for partnership exceeded those in the
great restless sea of awakened intelligence between the
highest type and the commonplace. Ranata, in more
passionate hours of longing and anguish, had felt the
possibilities she relinquished, rather than grasped them
with her reason, but now she knew their full significance,
and the knowledge helped her to deeper indignation of
the mediæval conditions into which she had abruptly
been thrust.</p>

<p>The days passed and the lover gave no sign that he was
as distraught as the prisoner. There are times in life
when one lives very fast. The first forty-eight hours of
her imprisonment consumed the mental energies of
months. As the first excitement decreased, and with it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[377]</span>
something of the novelty of her situation, her mind was
free again for thoughts and dreams she had been half
glad to forget, so many were the pangs they had held.
And in the train of love came all the doubts and tragic
conceptions with which a woman cursed with imagination
never fails to torment herself. The women for
whom men would most willingly die—if there be yet
that spirit abroad in the world—women who in the end
are most sure to discard the still ardent lover, often
suffer in their imaginary tragedies as intensely as their
more constant and less valued sisters in their hopeless
realities. Ranata was not the woman to love and tire,
but her imagination was the least controlled of her
faculties. She descended into the very depths of depression
and convinced herself that Fessenden Abbott
had taken her at her word and returned to America
before any one had suspected her imprisonment and
sent him warning. (The faithful maid had not dared
to confess her eavesdropping.) She might be confined
here until she lost her reason, and he would drown his
thoughts of her in the hideous details of business, or in
those great schemes of his, remembering her only as a
purified spirit; likely enough, wearying of the cold picture.
She forgot her ideals, even her instinctive knowledge of
him, and treated his vows with cynicism. What man in
this practical modern world—and the world was practical
and modern outside of the Hofburg—would be faithful
to the woman hidden forever from his sight? He would
marry, of course, and forget her; why, indeed, should he
not? And what if he did? There were times when she
hated him, when in the prolonged contemplation of his
commonplace infidelity she despised him as unworthy of
her, and hardened her heart until she doubted if it ever
would melt again, even if he suddenly appeared and
took her in his arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[378]</span>These crises in a woman’s brain are very unfortunate,
and when men are wiser they will study to prevent them.
After all, it is the psychical experience that tells, not the
visible cause, and the scars may be deep and callous. In
this case poor Fessenden was helpless, and Ranata had
still felt and known so little that she had elasticity enough
to survive several such crises without the worst effects;
but if life had added bitterness to her store of experience
she might have come out of her ordeal with her
best prospect for happiness blasted.</p>

<p>Time cured this mood; but the passing of doubt and
the restoration of the lover to favor helped her little to
serenity. She recalled every look, the tones of his voice,
every moment they had snatched together, all that he
had taught her. She remembered every trick of speech
and expression, the lighter but still personal habit they
had fallen into of sitting apart for a few minutes after
the tea-hour, while the others were drinking their coffee
in one of the reception-rooms, at the opera and theatre,
or riding to the Schwabenberg in the early morning.
These had become established habits, and she regretted
them almost as intensely as the more concentrated moments;
she had known to the full the tantalizing sweetness
of the intimate understanding in a crowd.</p>

<p>And she recalled all she knew of him through the stories
he had told her of himself in the years before they had
met. They revealed him in many phases, and she had
often lingered on them when alone. But there was one
that now seemed to be always in her brain, to rise vividly
in the brief moments when she was not struggling with a
passion of grief, of regret, above all striving to tear her
mind from the uncertainty, the maddening inability to act.</p>

<p>It was a brief graphic story of an adventure in a
mountain-pass in Venezuela, when with three or four
men he had been set upon by half a score of the threatened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span>
dictator’s followers. The case had been desperate,
there had been a few moments when he had never expected
to see a wider sky again, and in those moments it
was not so much he that had fought as Life itself. His
pistol emptied, stabbed, shot, his clothing almost off his
back, he was dragged to and fro on the rough mountain-road,
hacking, struggling, hating, not a harking in him
to his old love of the fight in that gasping tortured
wrestle with Death himself; possessed only by the
furious determination of Life to persist, to win against
the enemy that never for an instant sleeps on its trail—so
that the wonder is man lives a month from birth.
At the end it had seemed to him that he saw the two
ancient enemies at each other’s throats.</p>

<p>Fessenden’s face had been composed enough as he told
the story, but her imagination had visioned it set and
desperate, pictured the swollen chords of his neck, the
muscles on his half-naked and bleeding body bulging with
rage and resistance. His eye had glazed as Keene arrived
and put the assassins to flight, and he had sunk into
unconsciousness in bitterness and resentment, believing
that he was dying. None of his stories of brilliant and
reckless adventure had stirred her like this glimpse into
his primeval depths, depths which in the lower types
make for ruin, and when rarely in the ken of the great
forces of soul and brain are chief among the main-springs
of a man’s conquest over Life. The oftener this picture
recurred to her, the face convulsed, or indomitable and
grim, of the man she understood so well, the more was
she persuaded that something had happened to still his
energies, or he would have made her a sign before this.
It had not needed that story to convince her that his
courage would never fail him, but it now served the purpose
of suggesting a similar strait where a wild revolt
against death availed him nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[380]</span>It needed only a shock to send the blood to her head
and deliver her nerves from the control of her will, which
had struggled hard to keep in office. The shock came,
and Maria Leopoldina was the apologetic medium. She
entered Ranata’s sitting-room on the sixth morning of
the imprisonment with a newspaper, and pointed to a
marked paragraph. The news item stated that the
famous American, Herr Abbott, had sailed on his yacht
from Trieste for New York on the previous day.</p>

<p>Then it was that the blood flew to Ranata’s head and
stayed there. It disorganized her will, almost her powers
of consecutive thought. A moment of forgetfulness and
the tide of feeling, of terrified emotion, poured upward
again, shaking her body and racking her nerves. She
slept but a few hours at night, waking with a load of
despair and terror in her brain. Her desperate efforts at
self-control, her prayers for strength, were of no avail; for
it must be remembered that mental suffering is a physical
thing after all, psychical as may be the heights it is flung
upon, and, until it has spent itself, as little to be controlled
as a fever of the body. There was a constant
effort in her throat to gasp, and moments of such utter
and tumultuous despair that it seemed to her she saw
straight into the soul of her brother during his last
tormented moments. For it is in such depths of mental
suffering, when the passions are in absolute control of
the brain, and the victim if not mad might as well be,
that life is taken. The strength in Ranata’s soul fought
dumbly and persistently for mastery, and won in the
end, but a weaker woman, with imagination and passions
as strong, would have killed herself.</p>

<p>Finally she demanded of Maria Leopoldina—blissfully
ignorant of the tragedies enacting within the hard exterior
of her charge—a sleeping-potion; and the stewardess,
when she returned with it, brought also the information<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[381]</span>
that as a hasty marriage would undoubtedly cause
a scandal exactly similar to that which had entertained
Europe upon the informal exit into matrimony of the
late wife of the Archduke Aloys Franz, it had been
determined that the ceremony should not take place
until two months hence. The official announcement
of the engagement would be made presently, however,
and until the day of the wedding she must remain in
her rooms.</p>

<p>“Why, now that Mr. Abbott has gone?” asked
Ranata. “Why deprive me of my liberty when I could
make no use of it?”</p>

<p>“I cannot say, my dear,” answered Maria Leopoldina.
“It would not take him long to come back, you know;
and then you have not given your formal consent to
marriage with Aloys.”</p>

<p>“That is a point I had quite forgotten,” said Ranata
dryly. “I hope my father and my prospective husband
are not unduly impatient.”</p>

<p>On the following day, after the surcease of the sleeping-powder,
and the inevitable reaction from many days of
torment, she felt almost light-hearted and frivolous, and
wondered if it were possible to suffer like that more than
once in a lifetime. Passing a window her eye was idly
attracted by the shabby figure of a tourist. It was a
bright winter’s day, and visitors to the great capital
came to look at the fine bronze of old Emperor Franz
and the gilded wall where the drawbridge had been.
Ranata envied them deeply, nameless as no doubt they
were—she had a vague idea that all sight-seers were a
composite with a number—for they had their precious
liberty, no doubt belonged to such free and happy
countries as England and America.</p>

<p>This insignificant little woman carried a Baedeker,
which she read industriously, walking round and round<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[382]</span>
the statue, with but an occasional upward glance at the
work of art. Alexandra had told Ranata of tourists who
read their Baedekers on the Rhine, forgetting to look at
the historic monuments described, and she watched this
illustration with some amusement. Suddenly her brows
met, and she drew closer to the window. There was
something oddly familiar in the little deliberate steps,
in the fashion of opening and closing the book. And this
tourist had been here on other days, when her brain was
too surcharged to piece impression to thought! In a
moment the girl paused with her back to the window,
and, raising her hand, nervously twisted a curl on the
right of her neck. It was Vilma Festetics.</p>

<p>She turned, her curious tourist eye roving over the
ugly wall of the palace, concealing unimaginable splendors!
She even sighed, and let her mouth fall with
discontent. Ranata shook the edge of the curtain.
Vilma came forward laggingly, her eyes on her book.
The guard was inspecting the peculiar antics of another
tourist, who had a bulge beneath his coat. When
Vilma was directly beneath the window Ranata threw
it open and leaned out.</p>

<p>“He has not gone,” said Vilma distinctly, “and he
wants your answer before he proceeds further.”</p>

<p>And Ranata answered as distinctly: “Yes. Yes. Yes.”</p>

<p>It was all over in an instant. Vilma had shot through
the archway and mingled with the throng in the Michaelerplatz
and Ranata had closed her window before
the astounded guards realized they had been outwitted.</p>

<p>Ranata sat down to await the consequences of her act.
Her heart sang, and she did not care in the least what
they might be. Indeed, closer imprisonment, probably
a change of quarters, was the worst she had to fear; her
father was not benighted enough to put her in solitary
confinement, nor even on bread and water. She wondered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[383]</span>
at her doubts, at her facile acceptance of a news item that
no doubt had been inserted by order of the Emperor.
She knew now that Fessenden had made his plans and
that he would not fail. She looked back in amazement
at the power and instinct of woman to torment herself,
and she also felt a throb of satisfaction that she should
not grow old and ugly in the course of a month, as she
had fully expected to do. Finally she shed tears of wondering
gratitude, and for a few moments felt as humble
as a man could wish.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was not until two days later that Maria Leopoldina
announced herself to the Archduchess at an early hour,
and with an air of deep depression imparted the information
that they were to leave Vienna on the following
morning.</p>

<p>“I infer that we are bound for the country,” said
Ranata smiling. “It is unfortunate that you should
hate it as much as I love it. Cannot some other trustworthy
duenna be found?”</p>

<p>The Obersthofmeisterin shook her head with gloomy
pride. “How many people has his Majesty had reason
to trust? I may not be as brilliant at Sarolta, but I shall
live and die in the confidence of my sovereign. And as I
have borne so many crosses in this life, I may perhaps
hope for compensation in the next.”</p>

<p>“Where there will be no kings?”</p>

<p>“I see no fault in our august relative,” said Maria
Leopoldina hurriedly.</p>

<p>“I should not tell him if you did. Where are we
going?”</p>

<p>“That, I deeply regret to say, I am not permitted to
tell you until we are in the train. But we are going not
only because you have had the misfortune to incur the
royal displeasure, but because, as you are not to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[384]</span>
married immediately, his Majesty fears for your health
if you are confined too long in-doors.”</p>

<p>Ranata drew a long breath. “To live out of doors
again! Even alone it will be the next best thing to the
Atlantic Ocean on a yacht.”</p>

<p>“What?” demanded the stewardess sharply.</p>

<p>“Oh, you will not have to go to sea with me; and you
will be rid of me sooner than you think.”</p>

<p>On the following morning, Ranata, accompanied only
by Maria Leopoldina, three officers of the Emperor’s
household, and her servants, left Vienna, not in the
Emperor’s private car but in ordinary railway carriages
reserved for her use. She wore the plainest of her
travelling-frocks, nor was there anything in the appearance
of her modest suite to attract attention; and
in the heavy fog of daybreak even the mounted escort
that guarded her to the station passed unnoticed.</p>

<p>When Vienna was an hour behind them Maria Leopoldina
informed the prisoner that they were bound for
the Adriatic, for the castle of Miramar, built by Maximilian
several years before his departure for Mexico. The
information gave Ranata pleasure, for she had never seen
the beautiful home from which her uncle had sailed to his
romantic and ignominious fate. Her father and mother
had avoided it since long before her birth, but she knew
that the castle was as comfortable as it was magnificent,
and that there were grounds in whose labyrinths she
could walk for hours without the monotony of repetition.
Suddenly she had an inspiration.</p>

<p>“Did my father order Mr. Abbott’s yacht to leave
Trieste?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Ah!—well, it can do no harm—he did.”</p>

<p>“Where is it?”</p>

<p>“That I do not know. I think his Majesty has not
inquired—so long as it is not in Austrian waters.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[385]</span>“Does my father expect to keep my departure, my
residence at so conspicuous a spot as Miramar, a secret?”</p>

<p>“That will not matter. There will be an official
announcement made that you are gone to the sea to
recuperate from an attack of the influenza, and a man-of-war
has been ordered to Trieste; it will anchor off the
castle. The guard in the castle and grounds has been
quadrupled from the garrison at Trieste. Moreover—I
will tell you all, as it can do no harm—Mr. Abbott has
given his <i>parole d’honneur</i> that he will make no attempt
to carry you off; he wished you to be removed to the
country, it seems. He has had the audacity to ask your
hand of his Majesty. I suppose he is of unsound mind,
poor young man.”</p>

<p>And Maria Leopoldina had the profound satisfaction
of writing to her sovereign and cousin that evening
that his daughter had received this proof of American absurdity
and presumption with a peal of laughter which
had warmed her own heart, heavy with responsibility,
and with sympathy for his most gracious majesty.</p>

</div>

<p>The Emperor of Austria, the Emperor of Germany, Mr.
Abbott, and Fessenden Abbott sat in secret and informal
conclave in a small audience-chamber in the Hofburg.
The host sat behind a table between two high and heavy
golden candlesticks. The Emperors, erect in their uniforms,
were imposing figures. They had the free supple
upright carriage of men whose lives have been more
than half passed in the saddle, and their eyes sparkled
with the evidence of exercise and fresh air, regular
habits, and systematic care. Mr. Abbott, in a frock-coat,
was huddled in a perpendicular chair of crimson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[386]</span>
velvet and gilded oak, in a vain endeavor to make himself
comfortable, and surreptitiously consuming tabloids;
suffering in the stomach he had failed to treat as
a brother the tortures of the damned. He looked with
envy at the older Emperor who had been born some
twenty years before himself, had endured enough public
cares and private castigations to kill half a dozen
Americans, and looked more vigorous than many in
their youth. It was even possible that he might outlive
the young man who aspired to be his son-in-law; toward
whom his eyes, in spite of his will, wandered in the
fascination of a shock from which he found himself
unable to recover.</p>

<p>It was now a fortnight since he had been made aware
that nothing less was asked of him than that he should
give his daughter in marriage to a scion of a country not
only devoid of every tradition of royalty, but of an
hereditary aristocracy; and while he was still stunned
and dully alarmed for what he conceived to be his
failing wits, this demand had been backed up by an
offer which had awakened him, it is true, but, he having
outlived the age of romance and enthusiasm, had by
no means met with favor, nor even credulity. To avoid
war in any form was the final ambition of his life, and
he was proud of his position as keeper of the peace of
central and eastern Europe. On the other hand, he
admitted that were he forty years younger he would
doubtless have grasped any reasonable opportunity to
rid Europe of the governments of Russia and Turkey,
civilize and give happiness to those two countries,
estimable enough in themselves, and mount to a place
in history high above the mistakes and disasters of his
unfortunate reign. But he was old, and with the
selfishness of the old had long since resolved that he
would close his reign in peace could it be done without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[387]</span>
dishonor. As for the inventions, they seemed to him
as chimerical as the prospective telegraph did to his
forefathers, as the telephone would seem to an Esquimaux.
Moreover, that the restless and uncertain quantity
who claimed him as his “fatherly friend” was the
one from whom the astounding proposition came, was
enough to fill his bosom to repletion with distrust; the
more especially as the invention was the property of an
American notoriously the German’s friend. The Emperor
took little interest in American history or affairs,
but it happened that he knew a good deal about Fessenden
Abbott; not only through the intimacy of Alexandra
with his daughter, nor yet through an acquaintance of
long standing with Mr. Abbott—for whom he had a
very considerable respect—but because of the young
man’s menacing exploit in South America, his establishment
of certain and apparently impregnable industries
in Europe, and his reputation as a manipulator of men.
No doubt he was the only man in his raw country who
would have dared so far as to love a princess of royal
blood, much less have had the incomprehensible audacity
to bargain for her hand; but of all men in any
objectionable republic whatsoever, the Emperor-King
knew of no one to whom under severest stress he would
longer hesitate to give any sort of recognition. He was
aware of young Abbott’s principles and theories; they
had been hammered into his smarting ears by the only
one of his children who had been dowered to the full
with the haughty and intolerant spirit of her race; and
he looked upon him as a menace to the best that was
left in the world. The wealth of these two men appalled
him, albeit he was the richest monarch in Europe; and
as he listened once more to the description of the incredible
inventions and their certainties, he found himself
staring at the little old man in the chair and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[388]</span>
vigorous restless young man standing by the window
much as a half-dazed man watches the approach of a
land cyclone, whirling houses, people, and trees in its
funnel.</p>

<p>He had been astounded that one of his generals,
whom he had sent to Berlin to witness the experiments,
had returned convinced, and advocating war; and he
had been still more astonished and upset when, in the
formal consultation which at the insistence of the German
Emperor he had held with his cabinets, he found
that to a man they were for accepting the offer of the
American. During the past week his ears had rung
to no tune but the glorious finish of his reign, the
inestimable service he had it in his power to bestow upon
Christianity and Europe, the sure future of his Dual
Monarchy—which the intoxicating knowledge of its
greatness would solidify. The only thing they had
stumbled over was the condition; for the Emperor was
no more conservative than his aristocracy, and the idea
of allying the most exclusive monarchy in the world with
the most blatant and dangerous of republics, that moreover
which had recently whipped one of the ancient
states of Europe, was a huge pill for them to swallow.
Had it not been that they all felt that Europe would
be well rid of this particular princess—even Königsegg,
with this alternative—it is doubtful if, no matter what
their reason for approving this projected war, they
would have opened their batteries upon the Emperor
But as it was, the old sovereign, who had permitted these
many years his advisers to do so much of his thinking
had an irritated subconsciousness of being trapped, and
hardly realized yet that he had actually gone so far as to
grant this private audience and to permit the royal
countenance to shine upon a manifest impossibility.</p>

<p>It was notable that the Emperor of Germany, in spite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[389]</span>
of his warm friendship for Fessenden, had drawn his
chair close to his host’s, and for the moment was in fuller
sympathy with him; an unconscious manifestation of
that <i>esprit de corps</i> which exists among great rulers,
no matter what their differences. Fessenden felt this
but did not resent it; but he also felt that it left him
practically alone, his father’s faculties being necessarily
bent to introspection; but the isolation merely put him
on his mettle, and he had fought too many battles
single-handed to feel any faintness of spirit. Even he did
not compare favorably in freshness with the two Emperors,
for he had known too many anxious hours in the
past three weeks, too many sleepless nights; but his
temper was now cast in iron.</p>

<p>“Your general, as well as the Prussian generals who
have witnessed the experiments, are satisfied that
failure is impossible,” he said, having finished the
description of the inventions, which, like all great inventions,
were simple enough. “It will be the first
time in the history of the world that a war will have
commenced with no uncertainty whatever as to the
issue.”</p>

<p>The Austrian Emperor answered with a German proverb,
the equivalent of “There’s many a slip ’twixt cup
and lip.”</p>

<p>“We include no bunglers in our calculations, sir,” said
Fessenden dryly. “Although every precaution will be
taken against their admittance in the first place.”</p>

<p>The Emperor turned to his brother of Germany, who
answered promptly: “I will confess that I entertained
the identical doubts of your Majesty, at first, but I have
since been fully convinced. And I am also convinced
that it is our great and only chance. Sooner or later,
doubtless before half a dozen years have passed, Russia
will be at war with Japan. That war may involve the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[390]</span>
rest of Europe, including ourselves; and fighting for our
lives perhaps instead of shaping history as we think
best. Sooner still there is bound to be trouble again
in Turkey, which may involve one or more of the
Balkans, and if we delay we shall once more be in the
periodically mortifying position of daring to do nothing
for the peace of Europe, for humanity, in our fear of
Russia. At present we are in the not imposing position
of merely holding on to our inheritances by what my
American friend would call main strength. I conceive
that a sovereign has a higher duty. This great power
is not given to him in the interest of his inheritance
alone, although no doubt its welfare is his first duty, but
as a stepping-stone to a greater power which shall benefit
the human race. It is often the case, as your Majesty
well knows, that a ruler may be so confined by circumstances
that he can make no such attempt without
causing disaster instead of benefit, but the great men
of history have been alive to the great moment. I
believe that ours has come, your Majesty.”</p>

<p>The old Emperor darted a glance at his rival and
friend, as though to note if his tongue were in his cheek.
He answered with the same accent of respect, however.</p>

<p>“I cannot fail to respond to words so stirring, your
Majesty, and I need not add that my conception of the
lofty duties of a ruler is precisely the same as your own.
But war in any case is a stupendous calamity, if only for
the loss of life it incurs. And in any conditions the
added responsibilities of conquered territory are among
the weightiest considerations which must always affect
a ruler no longer young. In this case, with the half of
Russia and Turkey and the Balkans to add to my
present heavy load, I confess the prospect does not
allure me! Reflect, your Majesty, that I have already
a perpetual nightmare in Hungary. If I were a generation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[391]</span>
younger I might contemplate with equanimity
the additional problem of sixty or seventy million more
subjects clamoring for constitutions, but not now!”</p>

<p>William did not reply that he would gladly relieve
his august friend of all but his countenance; he answered
quickly.</p>

<p>“It will be our part to civilize these people, to give
them the benefit of the reforms they have long been
promised and never granted. That will keep them
quiet for a while. When they reach the stage where
enough has begotten a desire for more, then we can deal
with them by another method for which we will have
the inspiration at the right moment. And in this war,
your Majesty, there need be no loss of life on our side;
there will of course on the other for a short time, but
less by many thousands than both Turkey and Russia
will cause before Europe is many years older, less than
die of famine and filth every year.”</p>

<p>He stood up, his eyes flashing, his cheeks glowing.
Europeans, unlike Anglo-Saxons, are not afraid of expressing
lofty sentiments, and William was the last man
to consider whether people approved or not of any
sentiments he chose to entertain. “I believe that it is
our destiny, your Majesty,” he cried. “And that it is
the greatest destiny that ever has befallen any sovereign.
For, I swear to you all, I have no desire to be a second
Napoleon, crushing and ravaging, but to rule men for
their good, to have a vast empire in which human life
shall be as protected, as safe, as it is in my own empire
to-day, where all may have a chance to prosper and be
happy, to worship God in their own way, where such
tyranny of the mind and body as still exists in these
benighted parts of Europe—to our shame, your Majesty,
to our shame!—will be abolished so completely that
the children of those who suffer so bitterly to-day shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[392]</span>
listen to tales of the past with incredulous amazement.
I have burned for this since the day I ascended the
throne, but I had no right to plunge my country into a
war in which the chances were all against me. Now I
believe that the day has come!—the day has come! And
I beg, I implore your Majesty not to throw away this
opportunity to make our names and our empires the
most invincible on earth, our opportunity for good such
as no sovereign before has ever dared to dream of. If
we let it pass we deserve the worst that can befall us.
But it is impossible for me to believe that your Majesty
will let it pass. I have seen it all before me! I have
already lived in that future—ruled by the sword, by
kings divinely appointed, sternly, inflexibly, but with
wisdom, with kindness, with justice. I have been
cramped, thwarted, balked at every turn; there have
been times when my interest, even my courage, has almost
failed me; but with a power so vast as this conquest
would give me, I should be invincible, the enemies
in my present empire would crumble. Far from fearing
such increase of power, of responsibility, I court it,
I am eager for it, for with no lesser weapons can I accomplish
the destiny to which I was born.”</p>

<p>Even Mr. Abbott had forgotten his pangs, and a faint
glow of excitement had entered his gray cheeks. Fessenden,
thrilling, forgot his own desires for the moment: he
knew that however the Emperor might feel to-morrow
that was the way he felt to-day. Indeed there had been
little exaggeration in his mood. William thoroughly
believed in himself and in his gifts and mission as a ruler;
and no matter what the causes of discontent which had
bred the German socialist of to-day—causes insignificant
enough when compared with those of even Italy and
Spain, leaving out Russia and other barbarous states—no
one questioned the clock-work system of rule in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[393]</span>
country, the security of life and freedom of conscience,
and the solid industrial basis on which he had set it.</p>

<p>The Emperor of Austria knew him well enough to
believe in him when he was excited, at least, and he too
felt a spark fly up from the ashes in his breast. He
answered temperately, however.</p>

<p>“I should be the last to forbid the fulfilment of such
worthy ambitions, your Majesty, had this opportunity
come to us in the regular and legitimate channels.
But not only does it savor too much to my mind, grown
old in practicality, of Aladdin’s lamp, but it would place
us under an obligation to a republic on another continent
which, it seems to me, is full of portent.”</p>

<p>“The obligation is a personal one, your Majesty; and
when we are in possession of Europe I think we will be
in a position to force our own tariff conditions on the
United States. More I cannot say.”</p>

<p>The older Emperor leaned across the table and fixed
him with his eye.</p>

<p>“Your Majesty,” he said solemnly, “are there any
conceivable conditions in which you would marry your
daughter to an American?”</p>

<p>William had expected this question, and had trusted
to inspiration to answer it without betraying the fact
that no such circumstances existed in the womb of Time.
“Your Majesty,” he replied quickly, “may I not answer
your question with another? Is not the Archduchess
Ranata Theresia a menace in her own remarkable self
to the peace of your empire, and doubly so since she has
given in Hungary the evidence of her talents, and
achieved a popularity that no sovereign in Europe enjoys?
I heartily wish she had been born a man, but as
it is I must frankly insist that the future peace of
Europe depends as much upon her removal as upon any
other cause.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[394]</span>“What you say is true enough,” replied the ruler of the
Dual Monarchy gloomily, “but she can be removed
otherwise. You are informed of the alliance I have in
mind?”</p>

<p>“I am, your Majesty, and with all my humble deference
for your judgment I am forced to say that I do
not believe such a marriage would effect the result we
desire. In the first place, it would be a contest of two
strong wills, and your daughter is a woman of Hapsburg
gifts, quite aside from her force of character; in
the second place, she is a woman of uncommon fascination.
No doubt she would bind the Archduke Aloys
Franz hand and foot, and gratify her ambitions through
him; it must be remembered that she could not be asked
to take the oath of renunciation, your Majesty.”</p>

<p>The Emperor of Austria stirred uneasily. His daughter’s
charm as a woman had never seriously occurred to
him, but he saw the danger in a flash. Would it not
indeed be better to get her out of Europe? But he
looked at the American leaning against the casement,
encountered the cold blue eyes before which millions
seemed ever passing in review, and stiffened. The
temptation fled. The idea was preposterous enough,
without a son-in-law who would make him feel as if
Europe were on a library-shelf in an antique binding.</p>

<p>“She can be shut up,” he said briefly. “There is no
necessity to marry her at all. Such things have been
done, and they can be done again—with all kindness,
of course, but as securely as if in an underground
dungeon.”</p>

<p>Fessenden strode forward and stood in front of the
table.</p>

<p>“Is that your answer?” he asked.</p>

<p>“That is my answer.”</p>

<p>“That you would shut up a woman like that as if she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[395]</span>
were a lunatic or an idiot, without liberty, without
friends, until she went mad or killed herself?”</p>

<p>“What would be done would be for the good of the
state, and she herself would see it in time.” The last
words were not emphatic, but it was evident that the
gorge of the Emperor was rising.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, you will do nothing of the sort,” said
Fessenden.</p>

<p>“What?” The Emperor was on his feet. Angry as he
was, he stood erect and majestic against the red wall, an
imposing figure; but the old man and the young man, the
old world and the new, glared at each other between the
tall candelabra.</p>

<p>The other men had also risen. The Emperor of Germany,
who had had an instant of deep depression, felt his
spirits rise, and at the same time resented the light
treatment of majesty.</p>

<p>“You will do nothing of the sort,” repeated Fessenden.
“And before the month is out you will give me your
daughter in marriage here in the Hofburg. I have had no
desire to threaten you, to make you feel your impotence;
I hoped that, like the Emperor of Germany, you would be
sufficiently enlightened to take advantage of the offer I
made—an offer in which you would have had no share,
by the way, but for the daughter you propose to treat as
if she were a wooden doll, or you some long-forgotten
Hapsburg. Now I will tell you, your Majesty, why
you will neither incarcerate her nor forbid her marriage
to me. If you withhold your consent for twenty-four
hours, I shall take the train to-morrow for St. Petersburg
and make the same offer to the Russian government.
You may imagine how long they would hesitate. With
such assurance of success they would strike to-day
instead of waiting a half-dozen years for greater preparedness.
Then, sir, when Austria was a province of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[396]</span>
Russia, your daughter would be the first prisoner set
free.”</p>

<p>The Emperor had fallen heavily into his chair. As
Fessenden finished speaking, William, with a gasp,
walked to the window. There was a moment of intense
and painful silence, and then the German Emperor
spoke.</p>

<p>“He will keep his word, your Majesty.”</p>

<p>The Emperor rose. His face was almost purple. His
heavy Hapsburg mouth was trembling.</p>

<p>“I shall give you your answer before to-night,” he
said to Fessenden, although he did not look at him.
“And now I beg that you will excuse me. I am unable
to stand any more.”</p>

<p>He passed out. William turned to Fessenden. His
eyes sparkled with excitement, but he frowned.</p>

<p>“The battle is won,” he said. “But what a <i>coup
d’etat</i>! I am thankful I knew nothing of it.”</p>

<p>“I should have been a poor sort of friend to have
taken you as deeply as that into my confidence.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Well, I wish the Emperor could have consented
more gracefully. I hated seeing him driven to the
wall like that.”</p>

<p>“So did I. But it was success or failure. The odds
were even. He is the ruler of a great empire, skilled in
power and diplomacy. If I had hesitated to use the only
available means of success, I should not be worth my
salt. For that matter, he merely followed a law of
Nature.”</p>

<p>“Well, you have won, and I wish you joy. No doubt
you will see her before many days have passed.”</p>

<p>As they were leaving the room, Fessenden laid his
hand on the other’s arm. “Always remember,” he
said, “that I am no trafficker in human beings. I
throw this great power into your hands because I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[397]</span>
believe you will govern so wisely that your people will
be fitted for the great European republic before you
die.”</p>

<p>“<i>Ach was!</i>” said the Emperor of Germany.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">XXXV</h3>
</div>

<p>The <i>bora</i> which had raged for days, making it not only
unsafe but impossible to venture out of doors, had flown
round the isthmus to torment Fiume. The blue Adriatic
sparkled in a great silence, and, so brilliant was the
atmosphere, Ranata could fancy she saw Italy far away
on the edge of the level waters. Even the little breakers
at the foot of the castle growled like cubs instead of
bellowing in fury at the high confident roar in the pine
tops on the hill. The white castle, with its Norman
tower and gateway and innumerable turrets, fresh,
strong, symmetrical, solitary on the long curving line
of white coast, whose little peninsula juts abruptly
from the wooded mountain into the sea, was the fairest
prison that had ever held a princess captive. The
bluest sea in the world was at its feet, the yellow sun
flamed in a sky almost as blue, and on the mountain
behind were the everlasting greens of cypress and pine.
There is no more dazzling combination of color in the
world, and on moonlight nights it is but the exchange
of gold for silver.</p>

<p>Ranata, standing on the stone terrace in front of the
library and overhanging the sea, her back to the war-ship
on the right of the castle, her eyes roaming from the incomparable
expanse of the Adriatic to Trieste and the
mountains beyond, felt that with knowledge, in addition
to the faith that sustained her, she could serenely endure
her exile throughout what she believed to be the inevitable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[398]</span>
months. She had now been two weeks at
Miramar, and kings might have died and dynasties
fallen, the very continents might be at war, for all the
news that had come to her from the world. Not a letter,
not a newspaper, passed the sentries at the gates; the
grounds swarmed with guards; one paced the terrace
where she stood; others were on duty at the head of the
staircase at night. She met Maria Leopoldina at the
second breakfast and at dinner, and was accompanied
by that vigorous duenna on her long walks in fine
weather, but subjects of common interest had long since
been exhausted and they bore each other silent company,
the older woman too thankful that her charge
was amiable to repine at her own fate.</p>

<p>Complete faith had restored Ranata’s peace of mind,
delivered her even from variability of mood, and on the
whole she had been glad of these many days alone. She
no longer yearned with romantic melancholy for life
companioned but by a spiritualized memory, but examined
herself and her possibilities conscientiously, and
dwelt much, if soberly, in the upper air. If she idealized
Fessenden and the matrimonial state, that did her no
harm. Still, the time seemed long, and she had not the
least idea by what method the American lover purposed
to induce a Hapsburg to give him his daughter in
marriage. She knew that he would succeed, but she
also knew that the petrifactions in his way might yield
very slowly even to his energy and habit of success.</p>

<p>She sighed and entered the castle. Her morning walk
had been a long one, and she returned to the library for
rest and the unfailing distraction it afforded her. It was a
lofty room, not too large, the light woods of floor and
ceiling almost reflecting the sunshine which poured
through the windows. Each one of the six thousand
books in many languages looked as if personally selected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[399]</span>
by the poor gentleman and scholar who had graced so
delightfully the one sphere for which Nature had designed
him, and in whose alien rôle naught had become him
but his death. The room had been bright even while
the <i>bora</i> seemed to blow the very sun about the sky,
and the books in their haphazard bindings looked so
gay and fresh that it was difficult to believe their owner
had left them forty years before. Only the photographs
of friends, which covered the walls of the adjoining
study, were faded, their garments old-fashioned.
Eugénie, in her crinoline, looked like a by-gone fashion-plate;
even her autograph was dim; for the pictures
had been hastily thrust into ordinary little wooden or
gilt frames, and unprotected by glass. The beauty of
Elizabeth had retired to the inmost folds of her hideous
Victorian costume, and of her two oldest babies, taken
with her, little was noticeable but the bulging brow and
solemn eyes of Rudolf. But the crimson of hangings
and chairs was still fresh and vivid, the heavy woodwork
of the low ceiling, its design repeated in the
floor, was highly polished, the pen on the table might
have been dropped yesterday; all the clocks had been
ticking these forty years. Every room in the castle
looked as if designed and furnished by the happy
young couple, but these two rooms were still most personal,
still were pervaded by the refinement, the love
of comfort and of home, of Maximilian and Carlotta.
Ranata, when forced to remain in-doors, spent most of her
time in them. In the library she had discovered five
volumes of <i>Reports on Explorations and Surveys</i>, fruits
of the thirty-third Congress of the United States, and had
read them diligently. She had succeeded in investing the
dry and spotted pages with a sentimental interest, all
things being possible to a woman in love; but although
most of the books she read at this time were written in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[400]</span>
English language, it must be confessed that she did not
find her profoundest distraction in the <i>Reports</i>. To-day,
however, she was taking down the fourth volume, albeit
with some humor, when Maria Leopoldina entered the
library hurriedly, consternation and amazement distorting
a countenance habitually masked with the mincing
placidity of the courtier.</p>

<p>“The ship is weighing anchor!” she exclaimed. “And
all but the usual guard have received orders—by telegraph
from Vienna—to return to Trieste. And that
is not all! I was asked a moment ago to look through
the spy-glass—a steam-yacht is approaching from the
Italian coast—they say it is Mr. Abbott’s. Can Franz
have gone mad? Good God! can he be dead?”</p>

<p>Ranata dashed past her, and up the stair to the tower-room,
where she had spent so many hours scanning the
horizon through the glass. A moment later, in its
burgee, she had read the personality of the rapidly
approaching yacht. It was the <i>Alexandra</i>; and the
war-ship was steaming in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>When she turned to the agitated Obersthofmeisterin,
close upon her heels, she was trembling so violently she
hardly could stand, her cheeks were blazing, and she
thrust her hands into her heavy hair, and pulled it down
as if its weight were intolerable.</p>

<p>“It means,” she stammered—“it means—cannot you
see?—he has won—already—<i>I am to marry him!</i>” And
then Maria Leopoldina felt as if her nerves had been
assaulted by a swarm of hornets. Ranata collapsed
upon a chair, and flew into hysterics. She had suffered
in silence during that first awful week in the Hofburg,
pride carrying her successfully through even that ordeal;
and she had been calm enough during the past fortnight
of solitude and uncertainty; but in the face of this
sudden and violent prospect of victory and immediate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[401]</span>
happiness, her suppressed energies leaped their walls,
and she cried and laughed and talked incoherent phrases
until the duenna could stand no more and took refuge
in a dead faint.</p>

<p>Ranata promptly recovered her reason, and applied
the necessary restoratives without summoning help.
When she had led her vibrating relative to a sofa, and
fetched a bottle of salts, she arranged her own hair
and face, and returned to the tower to watch the approach
of the yacht. It steamed swiftly over the calm
sea, but to Ranata’s excited nerves hours passed before
she could read the ensign and burgee without the aid
of the glass. She was now schooled to any surprise,
but experienced a sharp thrill nevertheless when the
proud craft, instead of passing the castle and making for
Trieste, deliberately swung about and dropped anchor
upon the exact spot where the war-ship had kept its
vigilant watch. A moment later it ran up two flags, side
by side—the Austrian and the American.</p>

<p>Ranata sank again upon a chair and held her breath,
expecting to see a boat lowered and Fessenden descend.
But the long moments passed—an hour passed; the
incident appeared to be closed for the present. Officers
sauntered up and down the deck, sailors bustled about,
but no one appeared to manifest any interest in the
castle. Finally she was forced to conclude that, whatever
Fessenden had accomplished in Vienna, his yacht
had come without him.</p>

<p>To remain inactive any longer was beyond her electrified
nerves. She regarded Maria Leopoldina’s authority
as at an end, and it was evident that the shaken
Obersthofmeisterin was of the same opinion, for she
had dragged herself to her room, and was seen no more
that day. Ranata sent an invitation to the captain
and the officers of the yacht to lunch at the castle. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[402]</span>
lowered the flags and returned with the messenger; and
although there was an animated party in the little
dining-room up-stairs, all her subtle questioning was
able to extract were the bare facts that on the previous
evening they had received orders from their master in
Vienna to proceed in the morning to Miramar, run up
the two flags as they anchored off the castle, and not
to lower them until they had received some answering
signal from her. They were naïvely curious, and, face to
face with the Archduchess beloved of their chief, frankly
suspicious of the sequel. It was evident, however, that
her information was more meagre than theirs, and they
were so glad to get back to the tonic sweetness of the
Adriatic after their fortnight at Venice, most malodorous
of cities, and so enchanted with this beautiful princess
and her castle, that they were content without knowledge,
Yankees though they were.</p>

<p>After luncheon Ranata took them for a walk through
the gardens and woods of the park, keeping them until
they bored her, for she dreaded solitude and looked
forward to the night with terror. But before the night
came her nerves were to be lifted from the rack.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">XXXVI</h3>
</div>

<p>It was sundown and she stood on the terrace before the
windows of the state dining-room on the eastern side of
the castle, watching the shadows darken the woods rising
almost perpendicularly before her. She heard the train
go by high on the mountain, and sighed impatiently.
She was at liberty to take any train up there she wished,
and here she must remain in maddening unquiet. She
even felt some impatience with Fessenden, who surely
might have sent her a telegram.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[403]</span>But dinner had calmed her nerves—she had eaten no
luncheon, and once more took her evening meal at the
hour of five, that Maria Leopoldina might not add dyspepsia
to her other burdens—and she made an effort to
detach her thoughts from the fixed idea and subdue them
before bedtime. There was an infinity of suggestion in her
surroundings, and she conjured back the scene of nearly
half a century ago when Maximilian and Carlotta had
stood up in the boat at the foot of the water-steps down
on her left, smiling farewell to the throng of relatives and
friends who hung over the parapet or had crowded out
upon the narrow mole as far as the sphinx at its point.
Where the American yacht rode at anchor, a ship, in the
gala dress of flags and banners and pennants, had waited
to carry the brother of the Emperor to the imperial
destiny in which he and the many who loved him found
cause for pride. Some there may have been with
misgivings, but they trusted in France; and that an
Indian would in his dreams presume to treat an archduke
of Austria as a mere rebel was beyond the imagination
of any in that aristocratic throng—certainly unconceived
by the gallant and smiling gentleman who
looked his last upon Miramar. Throngs also—the
people of Trieste—had stood on the long flight of stone
steps with its three tiers, which led from Ranata’s feet
to the broad terrace below, leading, in its turn, to the
landing and the parapet; on the similar flight rising
opposite; and on the steps beyond, ascending steeply
to the quaint stiff old gardens. Ranata fancied the
scoop bonnets, the ugly garments over the crinoline; and
even the gay aftermath in the sky seemed to flaunt the
colors that had bedecked the fatal vessel.</p>

<p>But visions and the past fled to their limbo. From
the mountain came a wild peculiar cry, the supposed
Indian war-whoop with which herself and Alexandra<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[404]</span>
had been accustomed to pierce the repose of Ischl and
Schönbrunn, when younger. For a moment she believed
it to be another delusion; but it was repeated
and careless of the astonished sentry she answered it.
She skirted the upper parapet and first garden with a
fair assumption of dignity, and entered the dim twilight
of a long arbor covered with wisteria vine and ivy.
Here she picked up the tail of her gown and sped onward,
and then up flight after flight of steps, along wild path
and avenues and arbors, and up, up, again, until she
suddenly came upon Alexandra followed by her maids
and a score of the Hofburg servants. The girls kissed
each other formally, although one was palpitating with
more than exercise, and the other bulged with news
repressed. When they finally reached the library Ranata
had never been paler.</p>

<p>“Tell me quickly!” she exclaimed. “This change—these
changes—why have I received no official information?
What does it all mean?”</p>

<p>“That the Emperor has practically washed his hands
of you, my dear, and that your day for receiving official
information is over—for which I hope you are duly
thankful. It has been a long and weary tussle, but
Fessenden has won on every score but the last: he was
set on marrying you in the Hofburg, but there your
father held out. They were at it alone for two hours,
and even Fessenden was limp when he left the palace,
while the poor Emperor went to bed and slept ten hours
instead of seven. No argument nor reasoning could move
him. In so far as he could punish and humiliate you he
would; moreover, he wishes the public to know nothing
of the affair until it is over. Fessenden was forced to give
way, partly because he didn’t want to be the death of him,
partly because every delay involves too much risk. So,
my dear, prepare for the shock—they are all coming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[405]</span>
to-morrow—the Emperor, my father and Fessenden, the
Archdukes and Constitutional Cabinet—to witness the
oath of renunciation, the Archbishop to administer it—not
a woman but myself and Maria Leopoldina—no
wedding-gown—I begged him to let me bring one, but
he said you should be married in a travelling-dress and
hat and go from the chapel to the yacht. He is fearfully
upset, and I confess my knees shook when I received his
summons to the Hofburg yesterday. He gave me my
official instructions, if you like to call them that, in less
than ten minutes, and then wouldn’t even shake hands
with me, much less kiss me. Well—there you are! Of
course, if you want to retreat it is not too late.”</p>

<p>The words had dinned into Ranata’s ears like the
inharmonious clashing of many bells, and her mental
attitude was little less homogeneous. Her conquering
sensation was one of profound humiliation, accompanied
by a vivid appreciation of all she was renouncing. In less
than forty-eight hours she would be no longer the daughter
of a great empire, Archduchess of Austria and Princess
of Hungary, but a <i>citoyenne</i>, a unit of a huge and heaving
republic. And, barring the unavoidable ceremony of
renunciation and the distinguished witnesses, she was to
be married and despatched as were she one of her own
maids. Was love so tremendous a thing that it was
worth the barter of birthright and the loftiest state to
which a mortal might be born? Ranata had driven
forth most of her traditions, but she was the descendant
of eight centuries of kings, and her Americanism was yet
in the making. She looked hard into the future, and
wondered. At this juncture Alexandra produced a letter.</p>

<p>“It is from Fessenden. I will leave you alone with it
if you will tell me where I am to sleep. I dined on the
train, but I’d like to get into something loose.”</p>

<p>Ranata took the letter. It warmed her hand and she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[406]</span>
smiled. “You had better take my aunt’s room,” she said.
“It has two beds, and to-morrow night I will sleep with
you there. I have been using the state bedroom, as it has
fewer associations, but I shall have to give that to my
father. What on earth are we to do with all those
people? Some will have to go to the villa up on the hill,
or to the hotel in Trieste—this castle is not so large as it
looks. I suppose Fessenden will sleep on the yacht?
Thank Heaven there will be plenty to think about.
What time do they arrive?”</p>

<p>“At half-past four, on a special train—so that the
Emperor may dine as usual at five. The ceremonies are
to be performed on the following morning, and your
father’s train will leave for Vienna at twelve. My father
and I start in the evening for Genoa, whence we sail for
New York. I suspect the Emperor hates the thought of
coming here, but in his present frame of mind it is the
less of two evils.”</p>

<p>Ranata escorted Alexandra to the simple blue and gray
bedroom with its two pathetic little beds, then went to
the state bedchamber in which she had lodged for the
past fortnight. It was a superb and stately room, in
which, like the rest of the castle, one might yet be
comfortable. The old French bedstead was of massive
gilt, with high and twisted pillars, but open above;
and on the walls and on the furniture was the crimson
brocade wrought with the Mexican eagle and imperial
crown; a tapestry which the prince who ordered it had
never seen. Contemporary kings, a pope and a queen,
with their coats-of-arms above the frames, covered much
of the walls; and most of those who had sat to please
their friend were dead. Beyond was the great audience-chamber,
hung and furnished with the same imperial
crimson, but with fewer paintings: the Emperor of
Austria when young; Elizabeth in her exquisite and high-spirited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[407]</span>
youth; and Maximilian in his ermine, looking
still, majestic as was his figure, the gentleman and the
scholar and no more—the heavy open mouth the index
to his failure in the alien rôle. Continuing the great
suite were similar rooms, where the eagle and the crown
deepened to blood shade in the twilight.</p>

<p>Ranata looked about her lingeringly. It was all a
mockery, to be sure. Had her father possessed a proper
sense of humor he would have burned the tapestries
and the portrait, done all that he could to obliterate the
memory of a fiasco which would have been one of the
passing absurdities of history had it not been for the
untimely finish of an estimable man and the more cruel
fate of his wife; nevertheless it was impressive in its
high and perfect harmonies and in its serious intent,
and it expressed sufficiently all that she was about to
renounce. Moreover, she was leaving the loveliest and
most various country in Europe—for what? She might
have this beautiful castle for her own did she remain
Archduchess of Austria, and in Europe there must always
be a thousand compensations that could never be found
in a new country among a crude and alien people, were
love less than she had dreamed. A composite of
woman seemed to come forth from the shades and warn
her that love was not all, nor yet enough, for man
demands all, yet so little, giving less in return. The
music of the Chardash rose, as the ghost of the dead
women drifted on; and then the words of Sarolta. But
in a moment she lit a candle and read Fessenden’s letter.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">XXXVII</h3>
</div>

<p>They arrived on the following afternoon, the Emperor
and his American guests, his relatives, his primate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[408]</span>
two or three members of his household, and his ministers.
It was raining when they left the train at the little
mountain-station, and there was no driveway, no
alternative but to walk down the steep and winding
paths and stairs, sheltered by the umbrellas the lackeys
held over them. As the long file under the umbrellas
emerged from the arbor into the garden, the Emperor
picking his way daintily on his diminutive toes, and the
Archbishop holding up his gown with both hands, while
the gorgeous flunkies streamed with rain, the sight
was not as imperial as it should have been, and two
girls in an upper window giggled irreverently. Being
uncertain of their status, they left Maria Leopoldina
to receive in solitary state, and did not appear until
dinner; but when this solemn hour arrived, Ranata,
in an evening-gown of pale-green velvet and all her
pearls, entered the audience-chamber where the party
was assembled, greeted her father and the guests as she
had done many times before, and led the Archbishop
down to dinner. With Fessenden it was not possible
to exchange more than a flash.</p>

<p>It was a dreary function. The Emperor did not utter
a word, although he was graciously pleased to intimate
that his guests might talk if they could. Mr. Abbott
ate his restricted meal with an expression of grim honor,
and felt himself exempt from verbal expression. The
Emperor, perhaps with a corresponding sense of irony,
had asked him to occupy the state bedroom, lodging
himself in the little camp-bed with its tentlike curtains,
beloved of the sailor in Maximilian. The archdukes and
ministers mumbled at each other; Fessenden and Ranata
were many feet apart. Even Alexandra was depressed,
and stared at the ugly old masters on the walls,
longing for the solace of Zrinyi. Maria Leopoldina was
still in a state of bewilderment and horror, which made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[409]</span>
her fearful of attempting speech lest she gibber. At
times the ticking of the clock in the ceiling above the
table could be distinctly heard.</p>

<p>After dinner the Emperor and three of his friends
retired hastily to the study for a game of whist, the
others scattered, and Ranata and Fessenden found a
few moments alone in Carlotta’s boudoir in the tower.</p>

<p>For a time there was no conversation; then Fessenden
placed his hands on her shoulders and held her from him,
his eyes narrowing to a fiery point.</p>

<p>“Do you realize that I have won?” he said—“that
you and I are changing the face of the world?”</p>

<p>“Yes—Alexandra has told me everything. I think
you more wonderful than ever—but—is it for the best?
Changes should come in the slow course of events.”</p>

<p>“No change occurs that the world is not ready for.
The world has never been readier for the extermination
of Russia, particularly now that she has become a
menace to the United States. And the sooner Europe
is a republic the better.”</p>

<p>“I believe you care more for this part of your accomplishment
than for me.”</p>

<p>His eyes relaxed and the fires spread.</p>

<p>“No,” he said; “I do not. And we are all mere tools,
my dear.”</p>

<p>“If I were still superstitious,” she said a while later, “I
should feel very uncomfortable. I am sure this is a
subtle revenge of my father’s—not only to marry me
in this castle, but to force me to embark from the very
spot on which Maximilian said good-bye to Europe
forever. Your yacht is where the ship stood which
took him to Mexico. Not that my father wishes me
any such terrible fate, but he believes me to be superstitious,
and that I shall be punished by my imagination,
if not by my conscience. But it is too late for that!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[410]</span>
And Maximilian failed because he was Maximilian. I
believe you could not fail if you tried.”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="nobreak">XXXVIII</h3>
</div>

<p>The next morning at ten o’clock the Emperor and his
guests entered the great brown and gold and crimson
throne room with its imposing frieze of Hapsburg rulers,
its illustrated genealogy of the blended houses of
Hapsburg and Lorraine, crowned so naïvely with
Maximilian and Carlotta, its eleven graceful chandeliers,
and its meagre and apologetic throne. This the Emperor,
in the full-dress uniform of an Austrian general,
ascended with no apparent sense of its incongruity,
thankful, no doubt, that it stood ready for the occasion.
Before it was a table spread with a formidable-looking
document. On either side of the throne stood the
archdukes and the ministers, also in full uniform.
The Primate, in his robes of ceremony, faced the Emperor,
and Fessenden stood close to the table, his
father beside him. The rain had passed, the gay
southern sunshine flooded the fine room, where, for the
first time in its history, an emperor stood on its mockery
of a throne. It had been built for balls and other
functions of young and wealthy royalty, and in those
days the crimson tapestries had not been woven.</p>

<p>A moment after the Emperor had taken his position
on the throne, Ranata, accompanied by Alexandra, and
for the last time by an Obersthofmeisterin, entered and
walked proudly up the room. She wore, not the sombre
frock her father had had in mind when he issued the
imperial fiat that she should marry in travelling-dress,
but an elaborate and beautiful costume of white cloth.
The Emperor scowled, but felt himself helpless, for she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[411]</span>
also wore a hat, albeit with plumes that were truly
imperial, and framing and enhancing a beauty which
might have been conventionalized and half obscured
by orange-blossoms and lace. She wore the pearls
which her skin always seemed to reflect, her eyes
sparkled, there was a faint pink in her cheeks, a deeper
hue in her lips, and she had never borne herself with
a more subtle blending of triumphant beauty and the
dower of eight centuries of kings. She looked so happy
that even her relatives smiled in involuntary sympathy,
although they had never disapproved of a Hapsburg
more. As for Fessenden, who had been beating a light
tattoo on the table, staring at the document, he stood
suddenly erect, his eyes flashing their pride and delight;
and when they stood together before the throne
they seemed to fill the room with their victorious youth,
and to obliterate every memory of failure and tragedy.</p>

<p>The Emperor stood speechless for almost two moments.
Age might have atrophied his power to suffer,
and religion and philosophy have long since taught
him to accept the inevitable with little more than a
sigh; nevertheless, in these moments he felt a hot tide
of youthful rebellion rise from mould and mildew, and
of all the crosses he had been called upon to lift to his
shoulders this seemed to him the heaviest. The stillness
was so intense that many made a quick movement of
uneasiness. The Emperor recovered himself, and in
cold grave tones called upon all present to witness that
his daughter renounced her rights and titles, and, with
her betrothed, all pretensions to the thrones of Austria
and Hungary. The terms of the renunciation were
then read aloud by the prime-minister of Austria, the
Primate administered the oath, the affianced couple
signed the document, and Ranata for the moment
felt nameless and bewildered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[412]</span>But the signatures having been witnessed with due
solemnity, the party went at once to the little Jerusalem
chapel, and Fessenden gave Ranata what her father had
taken from her; and, so the Americans and the man in
him believed, far more besides. There was no breakfast,
for that would involve the drinking of healths with
their flowered expressions of approval, their reiterated
good wishes and will. The moment the brief ceremony
was over the Emperor led the way out to the terrace,
and down the long flight to that other terrace whose
lower steps were in the sea. A boat—its rowers with
tossed oars—awaited the newly wed, and beyond was
the yacht in gala dress of flags and banners and pennants.</p>

<p>Fessenden and Ranata were the last to leave the castle.
The others stood stiff and straight beside the two short
flights of steps leading into the water, the Emperor on
the right and slightly in front. The windows in this
angle of the castle were suddenly alive with servants, not
wholly unsympathetic, but no flunkies lined the long
flight to the lower terrace as the bridal couple descended.
Did Ranata think of the stately ceremonies in the
Hofburg, the dim and perfumed magnificence of St.
Stephen’s, the joyous pealing of all the bells in Vienna,
the procession to the church of prelates, and military,
and royalty in the six-horsed coaches of gilt and glass,
that the world had come to see, the congratulations of
every sovereign in Europe—all that would have been
hers had she married as an Archduchess of Austria is
expected to marry? Perhaps; for she was human, and
a woman; but doubtless she also reflected that she had
spent a goodly part of her life avoiding, with dexterity
or obstinacy, such a wedding-day as that; and, Fessenden
Abbott remaining unknown to her, she never would
have married at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[413]</span>But any such fugitive reflections were routed by the
prospect of the impending farewell with her father; for
the moment her very happiness seemed blighted. It
was true she had known him little, that her more
congenial older sisters had appropriated what love had
not been shocked out of him, but until these last weeks
she had had little to forgive, and indirectly she owed
her happiness to him; for she had laid its foundations
in the period of liberty he granted her. And he was her
father, nor was it likely she would ever see him again.
He stood like a soldier, staring at the yacht, nothing
betraying the genial kindness of his nature. When
Ranata, with her husband, reached the landing, the
Emperor turned and appeared about to favor her with
another of the cold and courteous bows which had been
her portion of late; but she saw that he was maintaining
the severity of his countenance with an effort, and
she approached him and put up her lips timidly. He
took her in his arms then and held her closely, and told
her that he forgave her, and hoped she would be happy.
After that her relatives came forward and embraced her,
the other Austrians kissed her hand for the last time,
and then Mr. Abbott and Alexandra went with her
down the water-steps and into the boat.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, sir, and thank you,” said Fessenden, as he
shook hands with his father-in-law. He was turning
away when he faced about again. “I should like to
tell you,” he added, “that I am not superstitious—and
neither is Ranata.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” exclaimed the Emperor. “Well—I am glad—I
am very glad.”</p>

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
